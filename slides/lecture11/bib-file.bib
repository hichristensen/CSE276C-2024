  abstract =     {This paper considers the distributed data fusion (DDF) problem
                  for general multi-agent robotic sensor net-works in
                  applications such as 3D mapping and target search. In
                  particular, this paper focuses on the use of conservative
                  fusion via the weighted exponential product (WEP) rule to
                  combat inconsistencies that arise from double-counting common
                  information between fusion agents. WEP fusion is ideal for
                  fusing arbitrarily distributed estimates in ad-hoc
                  communication network topologies, but current WEP rule
                  variants have limited applicability to general multi-robot
                  DDF. To address these issues, new information-theoretic WEP
                  metrics are presented along with novel optimization algorithms
                  for efficiently performing DDF within a recursive Bayesian
                  estimation framework. While the proposed WEP fusion methods
                  are generalizable to arbitrary probability distribution
                  functions (pdfs), emphasis is placed here on widely-used
                  Bernoulli and Gaussian mixture pdfs. Experimental results for
                  multi-robot 3D mapping and target search applications show the
                  effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

                  the generalized distributive law (GDL). The GDL is a synthesis
                  of the work of many authors in information theory, digital
                  communications, signal processing, statistics and artificial
                  intelligence. It includes as special cases the Baum-Welch
                  algorithm, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) on any finite
                  Abelian group, the Gallager-Tanner-Wiberg decoding algorithm,

                  propagation" algorithm, the Shafer-Shenoy probability
                  propagation algorithm, and the turbo decoding algorithm.
                  Although this algorithm is guaranteed to give exact answers
                  only in certain cases (the "junction tree" condition),
                  unfortunately not including the cases of GTW with cycles or
                  turbo decoding, there is much experimental evidence, and a few
                  theorems, suggesting that it often works approximately even
                  when it is not supposed to.},

                  the MPF problem using a "junction tree" representation of the
                  global function. Factor graphs may be viewed as an alternative
                  approach with closer ties to Tanner graphs and previously
                  developed graphical representations for codes. Es- sentially,
                  every result developed in the junction tree/GDL set- ting may
                  be translated into an equivalent result in the factor

                  probability propagation and the sum-product algorithm were
                  found to be the same thing \citep{Frey96ccc,Aji00it}. In
                  particular, the example of iterative decoding proved that
                  probability propagation, which had been used only for
                  cycle-free graphs, could be used also for graphs with cycles.}

  abstract =     {We investigate several basic problems in vision under the
                  assumption that the observer is active. An observer is called
                  active when engaged in some kind of activity whose purpose is
                  to control the geometric parameters of the sensory apparatus.
                  The purpose of the activity is to manipulate the constraints
                  underlying the observed phenomena in order to improve the
                  quality of the perceptual results. For example a monocular
                  observer that moves with a known or unknown motion or a
                  binocular observer that can rotate his eyes and track
                  environmental objects are just two examples of an observer
                  that we call active. We prove that an active observer can
                  solve basic vision problems in a much more efficient way than
                  a passive one. Problems that are ill-posed and nonlinear for a
                  passive observer become well-posed and linear for an active
                  observer. In particular, the problems of shape from shading
                  and depth computation, shape from contour, shape from texture,
                  and structure from motion are shown to be much easier for an
                  active observer than for a passive one. It has to be
                  emphasized that correspondence is not used in our approach,
                  i.e., active vision is not correspondence of features from
                  multiple viewpoints. Finally, active vision here does not mean
                  active sensing, and this paper introduces a general
                  methodology, a general framework in which we believe low-level
                  vision problems should be addressed.},

                  Bajcsy, 1988). Noting that biological vision is purposive and
                  active, researchers proposed that computer vision too should
                  aim at serving certain well-de ned goals such as navigation or
                  recognition rather than at constructing a general-purpose
                  representation of the world.}

                  preordering a symmetric sparse matrix prior to numerical
                  factorization is presented. We use techniques based on the
                  quotient graph for matrix factorization that allow us to
                  obtain computationally cheap bounds for the minimum degree. We
                  show that these bounds are often equal to the actual degree.
                  The resulting algorithm is typically much faster than previous
                  minimum degree ordering algorithms and produces results that
                  are comparable in quality with the best orderings from other
                  minimum degree algorithms.},

                  Observers were presented displays simulating forward
                  locomotion through a random dot field with the horizontal
                  position perturbed by a sum-of-sines function and were asked
                  to steer and null out the horizontal disturbance of the path
                  of locomotion. The results indicate greater control gain and
                  accuracy when presented with a repeating layout of landmarks
                  as compared to a changing layout of landmarks. Debriefing
                  responses suggest that observers may have implicitly learned
                  the layout of the repeating pattern. These results suggest
                  that observers use an allocentric representation of the scene
                  for steering control. A model for the control of locomotion is

                  modeling of doors from sensor data acquired in corridor
                  environments with mobile robots. The framework captures shape,
                  color, and motion properties of door and wall objects. The
                  probabilistic model is optimized with a version of the
                  expectation maximization algorithm, which segments the
                  environment into door and wall objects and learns their
                  properties. The framework allows the robot to generalize the
                  properties of detected object instances to new object
                  instances. We demonstrate the algorithm on real-world data
                  acquired by a Pioneer robot equipped with a laser range finder
                  and an omni-directional camera. Our results show that our
                  algorithm reliably segments the environment into walls and
                  doors, finding both doors that move and doors that do not
                  move. We show that our approach achieves better results than
                  models that only capture behavior, or only capture
                  appearance.},

                  synthesize a space-based optical interferometer, as envisioned

                  baselines large enough to achieve milli-arcsecond resolutions.
                  We explore the use of the covariance intersection (CI)
                  algorithm for state estimation of distributed spacecraft. The
                  CI algorithm provides a mechanism for fusing two or more
                  random variables with unknown cross-covariance such that the
                  computed covariance of the new estimate is consistent. We
                  consider the case of five spacecraft with a decentralized
                  estimation scheme where each spacecraft shares its own
                  estimates with the rest of the fleet using a ring-type
                  communication architecture. This simplified scenario of the
                  TPF mission is used to highlight the problems that can
                  originate if the cross-covariances are completely ignored. The
                  result shows that the CI filter performance instead is not
                  affected and provides good estimates},

                  reactive robot navigation that enables a robot to move in the
                  middle of the free space by exploiting both central and
                  peripheral vision. The robot employs a forward-looking camera
                  for central vision and two side-looking cameras for sensing
                  the periphery of its visual field. The developed method
                  combines the information acquired by this trinocular vision
                  system and produces low-level motor commands that keep the
                  robot in the middle of the free space. The approach follows
                  the purposive vision paradigm in the sense that vision is not
                  studied in isolation but in the context of the behaviors that
                  the system is engaged as well as the environment and the
                  robot's motor capabilities. It is demonstrated that by taking
                  into account these issues, vision processing can be
                  drastically simplified still giving rise to quite complex
                  behaviors. The proposed method does not make strict
                  assumptions about the environment, requires very low level
                  information to be extracted from the images, produces a robust
                  robot behavior and is computationally efficient. Results
                  obtained by bath simulations and from a prototype on-line

                  is no communication. Performarnce in terms of distance
                  traveled by each robot is measured when communication is
                  introduced. The robots use the shared memory communication
                  when robot looks into the shared memory when he doesn't have
                  any goal within his field of view.}

                  learning maps of visual environments, but traditional
                  map-making techniques are inadequate in several respects. This
                  paper describes an adaptive, view-based, relational map-making
                  system for navigating within a 3D environment defined by a
                  spatially distributed set of visual landmarks. Inspired by an
                  analogy to learning aspect graphs of 3D objects, the system
                  comprises two neurocomputational architectures that emulate
                  cognitive mapping in the rat hippocampus. The first
                  architecture performs unsupervised place learning by combining
                  the ?hat?with the ?here? namely through conjunctions of
                  landmark identity, pose, and egocentric gaze direction within
                  a local, restricted sensory view of the environment. The
                  second associatively learns action consequences by
                  incorporating the ?hen? namely through conjunctions of learned
                  places and coarsely coded robot motions. Together, these
                  networks form a map reminiscent of a partially observable
                  Markov decision process, and consequently provide an ideal
                  neural substrate for prediction, environment recognition,
                  route planning, and exploration. Preliminary results from
                  real-time implementations on a mobile robot called MAVIN (the

                  and/or angle measurements to each other and dead-reckoning
                  information to help each other navigate more accurately. One
                  typical approach is moving baseline navigation, in which
                  multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) exchange range
                  measurements using acoustic modems to perform mobile
                  trilateration. While the sharing of information between
                  vehicles can be highly beneficial, exchanging measurements and
                  state estimates can also be dangerous because of the risk of
                  measurements being used by a vehicle more than once; such data
                  re-use leads to inconsistent (overconfident) estimates, making
                  data association and outlier rejection more difficult and
                  divergence more likely. In this paper, we present a technique
                  for the consistent cooperative localization of multiple AUVs
                  performing mobile trilateration. Each AUV establishes a bank
                  of filters, performing careful bookkeeping to track the
                  origins of measurements and prevent the use any of the
                  measurements more than once. The multiple estimates are
                  combined in a consistent manner, yielding conservative
                  covariance estimates. The technique is illustrated using
                  simulation results. The new method is compared side-by-side
                  with a naive approach that does not keep track of the origins
                  of measurements, illustrating that the new method keeps
                  conservative covariance bounds whereas state estimates
                  obtained with the naive approach become overconfident and
                  diverge.},

                  planar faces from multiple images of a scene. The novelty of
                  the approach lies in the use of inter-image homographies to
                  validate and best estimate the plane, and in the minimal
                  initialization requirements-only a single 3D line with a
                  textured neighbourhood is required to generate a plane
                  hypothesis. The planar facets enable line grouping and also
                  the construction of parts of the wireframe which were missed
                  due to the inevitable shortcomings of feature detection and
                  matching. The method allows a piecewise planar model of a
                  scene to be built completely automatically, with no user
                  intervention at any stage, given only the images and camera
                  projection matrices as input. The robustness and reliability
                  of the method are illustrated on several examples, from both

                  study of Modeling and Control strategies for perception. By
                  modeling we mean models of sensors, processing modules and
                  their interaction. We distinguish local models from global
                  models by their extent of application in space and time. The
                  local models represent procedures and parameters such as
                  optical distortions of the lens, focal lens, spatial
                  resolution, band-pass filter, etc. The global models on the
                  other hand characterize the overall performance and make
                  predictions on how the individual modules interact. The
                  control strategies are formulated as a search of such sequence
                  of steps that would minimize a loss function while one is
                  seeking the most information. Examples are shown as the
                  existence proof of the proposed theory on obtaining range from
                  focus and sterolvergence on 2-D segmentation of an image and

                  active, researchers proposed that computer vision too should
                  aim at serving certain well-defined goals such as navigation

  abstract =     {To ambulate in an urban environment, we face the management of
                  many simultaneous tasks, such as walking on a sidewalk,
                  avoiding pedestrians, and crossing busy streets. The
                  management of simultaneous tasks has been studied extensively,
                  but those studies tend to focus on attentional loading in
                  reaction time experiments that use stimulus presentations of
                  less than one second. As a result, little is known about how
                  attention is managed in extended natural tasks that take on
                  the order of many minutes. The current study addresses the
                  extended allocation of visual attention. We study the gaze
                  control and locomotion control for a virtual humanoid agent
                  walking in a realistic simulated urban world. The agent��?
                  behaviors are directed by visuo-motor routines that each
                  handle a single well-defined task, such as staying on the
                  sidewalk or avoiding an obstacle. The key element in our model
                  is that behaviors ask for and are given access to the body on
                  a probabilistic basis. The probabilities are continually
                  adjusted to reflect the contingencies produced by the
                  environment. The gaze access period is adjusted to reflect the
                  modal time of human fixations in similar tasks. The locomotion
                  access period is adjusted to fit human performance data. Such
                  a model can explain how different behaviors can compete for
                  both eye gaze resources in addition to locomotion resources of
                  the body in a seamless manner. In our simulation, the humanoid
                  walks along a crowded sidewalk and crosses streets. During
                  this time the instantaneous allocation of resources to gaze
                  and ambulation are recorded. To test our model, we have human
                  subjects doing the same task. Humans wear head-mounted
                  displays that allow them to navigate in the same virtual
                  environment. Six-dof head-tracking as well as eye-tracking in
                  the HMD allows us to compare the use of gaze and locomotion by
                  the human subjects with our model. Our initial results suggest
                  that the probabilistic allocation of resources is a good fit
                  to the human data.},

  abstract =     {Animate vision systems have gaze control mechanisms that can
                  actively position the camera coordinate systemin response to
                  physical stimuli. Compared to passive systems, animate systems
                  show that visual computation can be vastly less expensive when
                  considered in the larger context of behavior. The most
                  important visual behavior is the ability to control the
                  direction of gaze. This allows the use of very low resolution
                  imaging that has a high virtual resolution. Using such a
                  system in a controlled way provides additional constraints
                  that dramatically simplify the computations of early vision.
                  Another important behavior is the way the environment
                  "behaves." Animate systems under real-time constraints can
                  further reduce their computational burden by using
                  environmental cues that are perspicuous in the local context.
                  A third source of economy is introduced when behaviors are
                  learned. Because errors are rarely fatal, systems using
                  learning algorithms can amortize computational cost over
                  extended periods. Further economies can be achieved when the
                  learning system uses indexical reference, which is a form of
                  dynamic variable binding. Animate vision is a natural way of
                  implementing this dynamic binding.},

  quotes =       {The most important visual behavior is the ability to control
                  the direction of gaze. ..[Animate vision] argues that vision
                  is more readily understood in the context of the visual
                  behaviors that the system is engaged in, and that these
                  behaviors may not require elaborate categorical
                  representations of the 3-D world. .. The human eye is
                  distinguished from current electronic cameras by virtue of
                  having much better resolution in a small region near the
                  optical axis. .. With the small fovea at a premium in a large
                  visual field, it is not surprising that the human visual
                  system has special behaviors (saccades) for quickly moving the
                  fovea to different spatial targets. .. Furthermore most of the
                  brain structures that represent visual information are
                  retinally indexed. This means that their state is changed with
                  each eye movement This raises a technical puzzle for human
                  visual perception: How can the world appear to be stable when
                  the data collecting process is so dynamic? We believe that
                  this is a profound question with a surprising answer: The
                  visual system provides the illusion of three-dimensional
                  stability by virtue of being able to execute fast behaviors.
                  .. The central asset of animate vision is gaze control. Gaze
                  control is the collection of different mechanisms for keeping
                  the fovea over a given spatial target. The single most
                  distinguishing feature of the human visual system is its
                  high-speed gaze control mechanisms. .. Gaze control mechanisms
                  fundamentally change computational models of vision. [] With
                  them a new paradigm emerges in which the visual calculations
                  are embedded in a sensory-motor behavioral repertoire. .. This
                  viewpoint has many different kinds of advantages. 1) Animate
                  vision systems can use physical search. []. 2) Animate vision
                  can make (approximately) known camera movements. []. 3)
                  Animate vision can use exocentric coordinate frames. [] 4)
                  Animate vision can use relative (or qualitative) algorithms.
                  [] 5) Gaze control can segment areas of interest in the image
                  pre-categorically. [] 6) Animate systems can exploit
                  environmental context. [] 7) Animate vision is tailor-made/or
                  learning algorithms that use indexical reference. .. We
                  further suggest that very different algorithms are used
                  depending on the task of the moment. A gross distinction that
                  can be made is between identification algorithms that analyze
                  the foveated area during fixation and location algorithms that
                  direct the eyes to new targets. .. Why should the primate
                  brain be specialized into two separate areas that are crucial
                  for different functions? If we think generally about the
                  problem of relating internal models to objects in the world,
                  then one way to interpret this dichotomy is as a suggestion
                  that the general problem of associating many models to many
                  parts of the image simultaneously is too difficult. In order
                  to make it computationally tractable within a single fixation,
                  it has to be simplified, either into one of location (one
                  internal model) or identification (one world object).}

                  creation of 3D models of man-made environments that we
                  represent as collections of textured planes. A typical
                  approach is to automatically compute a sparse feature
                  reconstruction and to manually give their plane-memberships as
                  well as the delineation of the planes. Textures are then
                  extracted from the images while optimizing the model,
                  typically the disparity between marked and predicted edges. We
                  propose a means to automatically estimate the model of the
                  scene, in terms of the number of planes and their parameters
                  from a point feature reconstruction. The method is based on
                  random sampling of reconstructed points to generate plane
                  hypotheses. Each of these is then evaluated using a measure of
                  approximate photoconsistency while recovering the
                  corresponding plane delineation. We then compute the maximum

                  network embedded in the environment. Sensor nodes act as
                  signposts for the robot to follow, thus obviating the need for
                  a map or localization on the part of the robot Navigation
                  directions are computed within the network (not on the robot)
                  using value iteration. Using small low-power radios, the robot
                  communicates with nodes in the network locally, and makes
                  navigation decisions based on which node it is near. An
                  algorithm based on processing of radio signal strength data
                  was developed so the robot could succcessfully decide which
                  node neighborhood it belonged to. Extensive experiments with a
                  robot and a sensor network confirm the validity of the

                  derived from an uncalibrated active vision system to navigate
                  an autonomous vehicle through free-space regions detected in a
                  cluttered environment. The structure of 3-space is recovered
                  modulo an affine transformation using an uncalibrated active
                  stereo head carried by the vehicle. The plane at infinity,
                  necessary for recovering affine structure from projective
                  structure, is found in a novel manner by making controlled
                  rotations of the head. The structure is composed of 3D points
                  obtained by detecting and matching image corners through the
                  stereo image sequence. Considerable care has been taken to
                  ensure that the processing is reliable, robust and automatic.
                  Driveable regions are determined from the projection of the
                  affine structure onto a plane parallel to the ground
                  determined using projective constructs. Two methods of
                  negotiating the regions are explored. The first introduces
                  metric information to allow control of a Euclidean vehicle.
                  The second uses visual servoing of the active head to navigate
                  in the affinely described free-space regions},

                  that it was possible to initiate obstacle avoidance behaviours
                  based on the limits of free-space regions detected. This work
                  was impressive, particularly as it operated without needing
                  knowledge of camera calibrations. It implemented in short
                  demonstrations which worked well, but consideration was not
                  given to the long-term goals of navigation and how the active
                  head could be used in many aspects.}

                  "acyclic" join dependency and a collection of functional
                  dependencies, and nothing else, that appears powerful enough
                  to describe most any real-world body of data in relational
                  database terms. Further, this class has many desirable
                  properties. Some properties make operations like updates and
                  the selection of joins to implement a query over a universal
                  relation especially easy. Other properties of interest were
                  studied by other researchers who described the same class in
                  radically different terms, and found desirable properties in
                  their own contexts. It is the purpose of this paper to define
                  the class formally, to give its important properties and the
                  equivalences with the other classes mentioned, and to explain
                  the importance of each property. This paper is intended to

                  topological maps of large-scale environments online. Existing
                  SSH implementations make very limited use of perceptual
                  information and thus create many candidate maps. Metrical
                  mapping implementations capture detailed knowledge about local

                  due to computational limitations and global metrical
                  uncertainty. In this paper, we extend the SSH to utilize
                  better sensory information by incorporating information
                  derived from local metrical models into the large-scale space
                  framework. This new extension of the Spatial Semantic

  abstract =     {A map is a description of an environment allowing an agent---a
                  human, or in our case a mobile robot---to plan and perform
                  effective actions. From a single location, an agent's sensors
                  can not observe the whole structure of a complex, large
                  environment. For this reason, the agent must build a map from
                  observations gathered over time and space. We distinguish
                  between large-scale space, with spatial structure larger than
                  the agent's sensory horizon, and small-scale space, with
                  structure within the sensory horizon. We propose a factored
                  approach to mobile robot map-building that handles
                  qualitatively different types of uncertainty by combining the
                  strengths of topological and metrical approaches. Our
                  framework is based on a computational model of the human
                  cognitive map; thus it allows robust navigation and
                  communication within several different spatial ontologies. Our
                  approach factors the mapping problem into natural sub-goals:
                  building a metrical representation for local small-scale
                  spaces; finding a topological map that represents the
                  qualitative structure of large-scale space; and (when
                  necessary) constructing a metrical representation for
                  large-scale space using the skeleton provided by the
                  topological map. The core contributions of this thesis are a
                  formal description of the Hybrid Spatial Semantic Hierarchy
                  (HSSH), a framework for both small-scale and large-scale
                  representations of space, and an implementation of the HSSH
                  that allows a robot to ground the large-scale concepts of
                  place and path in a metrical model of the local surround.
                  Given metrical models of the robot's local surround, we argue
                  that places at decision points in the world can be grounded by
                  the use of a primitive called a gateway. Gateways separate
                  different regions in space and have a natural description at
                  intersections and in doorways. We provide an algorithmic
                  definition of gateways, a theory of how they contribute to the
                  description of paths and places, and practical uses of
                  gateways in spatial mapping and learning.},

                  For classical problems, there is a logical order to this

                  Nonserial dynamic programming is a generalization of this;
                  typically the decomposition yields subproblems involving three

                  technique. Decomposition can be tried. The optimization
                  problem obtained is called a secondary optimization problem.
                  Let $G=(X,E)$ be an undirected graph without self-loops and
                  parallel edges. Given $x\in X$, the set $T(x)$ is the set of
                  vertices adjacent to $x$. Consider a vertex $y\in X$. The
                  graph obtained from $G$ by (1) deleting $y$ and all edges
                  emanating from it and (2) putting an edge between all the
                  pairs of vertices not adjacent in $G$ is called the
                  $y$-elimination graph of $G$ and denoted by $G_y$. The
                  operation is called the elimination of the vertex $y$. Call
                  the degree of an eliminated vertex $y_i$ in a given order of
                  elimination $y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M$ the dimension associated with
                  the elimination of the vertex $y_i$. The largest degree of the
                  eliminated vertices for an order of elimination
                  $y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M$ is called the dimension of the order and
                  denoted by $D(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M)$. The minimal dimension for
                  all possible orders is called the dimension of the graph $G$
                  and denoted by $D(G)$. The following problem is discussed:
                  Find an ordering of $y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M$ of $X$ which
                  minimizes $D(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_M)$. This is exactly the
                  secondary optimization problem which can be solved considering
                  only the interaction graph of the non-serial problem. There
                  are two algorithms known to solve the secondary optimization
                  problem but they are restricted to problems with 15--20
                  variables only. Based on two theorems proved in this paper,
                  further computational possibilities are presented, although no
                  formal algorithm is given. The computational significance of
                  the theorems is discussed and demonstrated by some simple
                  examples. Reviewed by D. Hochstadter}

                  for partitioning the image array into low-level entities based
                  on a model of the underlying image structure. A
                  piecewise-smooth surface model for image data that possesses
                  surface coherence properties is used to develop an algorithm
                  that simultaneously segments a large class of images into
                  regions of arbitrary shape and approximates image data with
                  bivariate functions so that it is possible to compute a
                  complete, noiseless image reconstruction based on the
                  extracted functions and regions. Surface curvature sign
                  labeling provides an initial coarse image segmentation, which
                  is refined by an iterative region-growing method based on
                  variable-order surface fitting. Experimental results show the
                  algorithm's performance on six range images and three
                  intensity images},

                  computer architectures. This paper is a unified and elementary
                  introduction to the standard characterizations of chordal
                  graphs and clique trees. The pace is leisurely, as detailed
                  proofs of all results are included. We also briefly discuss

                  maximal cliques containing v induces a connected subtree of T.
                  Such a tree is called a clique tree, and it can be computed in

                  distinguished from unreachable states at each planning stage,
                  and using this distinction among abstract states quickly to
                  identify infeasible regression paths. Note, however, the
                  GraphPlan approximates this distinction by overestimating the
                  set of reachable states. Overestimation (as opposed to
                  underestimation) ensures that the regression search space
                  contains all legitimate plans.},

  r-hoffmann01jair ={A third new approach is heuristic-search planning as
                  proposed by Bonet and Geffner (1998,2001). In this approach a
                  heuristic function is derived from the specification of the
                  planning instance and used for guiding the search through the
                  state space. As demonstrated by the system FF (short for
                  Fast-Forward) at the planning competition at AIPS-2000, this
                  approach proved to be competitive. In fact, FF outperformed
                  all the other fully automatic systems and was nominated Group
                  A Distinguished Performance Planning System at the
                  competition.}

                  approach to SLAM that achieves efficient mapping of
                  large-scale environments. The representation is a graph of
                  coordinate frames, with each vertex in the graph representing
                  a local frame, and each edge representing the transformation
                  between adjacent frames. In each frame, we build a map that
                  captures the local environment and the current robot pose
                  along with the uncertainties of each. Each map? uncertainties
                  are modeled with respect to its own frame. Probabilities of
                  entities with respect to arbitrary frames are generated by
                  following a path formed by the edges between adjacent frames,
                  computed via Dijkstra? shortest path algorithm. Loop closing
                  is achieved via an efficient map matching algorithm. We
                  demonstrate the technique running in real-time in a large

  abstract =     {In this paper we describe Atlas, a hybrid metrical/topological
                  approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that
                  achieves efficient mapping of large-scale environments. The
                  representation is a graph of coordinate frames, with each
                  vertex in the graph representing a local frame and each edge
                  representing the transformation between adjacent frames. In
                  each frame, we build a map that captures the local environment
                  and the current robot pose along with the uncertainties of
                  each. Each map? uncertainties are modeled with respect to its
                  own frame. Probabilities of entities with respect to arbitrary
                  frames are generated by following a path formed by the edges
                  between adjacent frames, computed using either the Dijkstra
                  shortest path algorithm or breath-first search. Loop closing
                  is achieved via an efficient map-matching algorithm coupled
                  with a cycle verification step.We demonstrate the performance
                  of the technique for post-processing large data sets,
                  including an indoor structured environment (2.2 km path

  abstract =     {We study the satisfiability of randomly generated formulas
                  formed by $M$ clauses of exactly $K$ literals over $N$ Boolean
                  variables. For a given value of $N$ the problem is known to be
                  most difficult when $\alpha=M/N$ is close to the experimental
                  threshold $\alpha_c$ separating the region where almost all
                  formulas are SAT from the region where all formulas are UNSAT.
                  Recent results from a statistical physics analysis suggest
                  that the difficulty is related to the existence of a
                  clustering phenomenon of the solutions when $\alpha$ is close
                  to (but smaller than) $\alpha_c$. We introduce a new type of
                  message-passing algorithm which can be used to find
                  efficiently a satisfying assignment of the variables in this
                  difficult region. This algorithm is iterative and composed of
                  two main parts. The first is a message-passing procedure which
                  generalizes the usual methods like sum-product and belief
                  propagation: It passes messages that may be thought of as
                  surveys over clusters of ordinary messages. The second part
                  uses the detailed probabilistic information obtained from the
                  surveys in order to fix variables and simplify the problem.
                  Eventually, the simplified problem that remains is solved by a
                  conventional heuristic.},

                  recursive algorithm to a sequence of images of a moving object
                  to estimate both its structure and kinematics. The object is
                  assumed to be rigid, and its motion is assumed to be smooth in
                  the sense that it can be modeled by retaining an arbitrary
                  number of terms in the appropriate Taylor series expansions.
                  Translational motion involves a standard rectilinear model,
                  while rotational motion is described with quaternions.
                  Neglected terms of the Taylor series are modeled as process
                  noise. A state-space model is constructed, incorporating both
                  kinematic and structural states, and recursive techniques are
                  used to estimate the state vector as a function of time. A set
                  of object match points is assumed to be available. The problem
                  is formulated as a parameter estimation and tracking problem
                  which can use an arbitrarily large number of images in a
                  sequence. The recursive estimation is done using an iterated
                  extended Kalman filter (IEKF), initialized with the output of
                  a batch algorithm run on the first few frames. Approximate
                  Cramer-Rao lower bounds on the error covariance of the batch
                  estimate are used as the initial state estimate error
                  covariance of the IEKF. The performance of the recursive

                  environment by a team of robots. As in single-robot
                  exploration the goal is to minimize the overall exploration
                  time. The key problem to be solved therefore is to choose
                  appropriate target points for the individual robots so that
                  they simultaneously explore different regions of their
                  environment. We present a probabilistic approach for the
                  coordination of multiple robots which, in contrast to previous
                  approaches, simultaneously takes into account the costs of
                  reaching a target point and the utility of target points. The
                  utility of target points is given by the size of the
                  unexplored area that a robot can cover with its sensors upon
                  reaching a target position. Whenever a target point is
                  assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored
                  area visible from this target position is reduced for the
                  other robots. This way, a team of multiple robots assigns
                  different target points to the individual robots. The
                  technique has been implemented and tested extensively in
                  real-world experiments and simulation runs. The results given
                  in this paper demonstrate that our coordination technique

                  previous approaches.},

                  localization and mapping (SLAM). We discuss it in the context
                  of estimating the 6 DoF pose of a mobile robot from the
                  perception of a monocular camera using a minimum set of three
                  natural landmarks. In contrast to our previously presented
                  V-GPS system, which navigates based on a set of known
                  landmarks, the current approach allows to estimate the
                  required information about the landmarks on-the-fly during the
                  exploration of an unknown environment The method is applicable
                  to indoor and outdoor environments. The calculation is done
                  from the image position of a set of natural landmarks that are
                  tracked in a continuous video stream at frame-rate. An
                  automatic hand-off process allows an update of the set to
                  compensate for occlusions and decreasing reconstruction
                  accuracies with the distance to an imaged landmark. A generic
                  sensor model allows a system configuration with a variety of
                  physical sensors including: monocular perspective cameras,
                  omni-directional cameras and laser range finders.},

                  eyes move through an evolving sequence of fixations to explore
                  the visual world, and to selectively gather information
                  critical to the task at hand. Computer vision systems must
                  follow similar smart sensing strategies if they are to perform
                  useful tasks in real time. Through intelligent selection of
                  data at an early analysis stage, systems can reduce the
                  overall computational cost by orders of magnitude. Through
                  smart sensing a vision system makes efficient use of limited
                  computing resources. We have built a machine, based on a
                  pyramid architecture, that supports smart sensing and related
                  highly efficient processing. Key elements of the design are a)
                  hierarchical data structures for image representation, b)
                  fine-to-coarse algorithms for the fast generation of image
                  measures, c) coarse-tofine search strategies that rapidly
                  locate objects or events within a scene, and d) high level
                  control mechanisms that guide data gathering even as visual
                  information is being interpreted. This system, known as the
                  Pyramid Vision Machine, achieves high performance at modest
                  cost. Design considerations and several applications are
                  described here.},

  abstract =     {Multi robot systems are envisioned to play an important role
                  in many robotic applications. A main prerequisite for a team
                  deployed in a wide unknown area is the capability of
                  autonomously navigate, exploiting the information acquired
                  through the on-line estimation of both robot poses and
                  surrounding environment model, according to Simultaneous
                  Localization And Mapping (SLAM) framework. As team
                  coordination is improved, distributed techniques for filtering
                  are required in order to enhance autonomous exploration and
                  large scale SLAM increasing both efficiency and robustness of
                  operation. Although Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF)
                  have been demonstrated to be an effective solution to the
                  problem of single robot SLAM, few extensions to teams of
                  robots exist, and these approaches are characterized by strict
                  assumptions on both communication bandwidth and prior
                  knowledge on relative poses of the teammates. In the present
                  paper we address the problem of multi robot SLAM in the case
                  of limited communication and unknown relative initial poses.
                  Starting from the well established single robot RBPF-SLAM, we
                  propose a simple technique which jointly estimates SLAM
                  posterior of the robots by fusing the prioceptive and the
                  eteroceptive information acquired by each teammate. The
                  approach intrinsically reduces the amount of data to be
                  exchanged among the robots, while taking into account the
                  uncertainty in relative pose measurements. Moreover it can be
                  naturally extended to different communication technologies
                  (bluetooth, RFId, wifi, etc.) regardless their sensing range.
                  The proposed approach is validated through experimental test.},

  abstract =     {Experiments by Fabre (1915), Thorpe (1950), Chmurzynski
                  (1964), and most recently Gould (1986) suggest that insects
                  have maps of their terrain which enable them to find their way
                  directly to a goal when they are displaced several hundred
                  metres from it. This paper discusses what might constitute an
                  insect's map in terms of a two-part computational model. The
                  first part describes how an insect reaches a goal when the
                  insect is sufficiently close that it can see some of the
                  landmarks which are visible from the goal. The second part
                  considers the problem of navigating when there is no
                  similarity between the view from the release-site and the view
                  from the goal. We start from a model designed to explain how a
                  bee might return to a goal using a two-dimensional snapshot of
                  the landscape seen from the goal (Collett and Cartwright
                  1983). To guide its return, the model bee continuously
                  compares its snapshot with its current retinal image and moves
                  so as to reduce the discrepancy between the two. Bees can only
                  be guided in the right direction by the difference between
                  current retinal image and snapshot when there is some
                  resemblance between the two. In a realistically cluttered
                  world, snapshot and retinal image become very dissimilar only
                  a short distance from the goal. To increase the distance from
                  which a model bee can return, the bee takes two snapshots at
                  the goal. The first snapshot excludes landmarks near to the
                  goal and the second snapshot includes them. With close
                  landmarks filtered from both snapshot and retinal image, the
                  match between the two deteriorates gradually as the bee moves
                  away from the goal. A model bee using a filtered snapshot and
                  image finds its way back to the neighbourhood of the goal from
                  a relatively long distance (Fig. 2). The bee then switches to
                  the second snapshot and is guided to the precise spot by its
                  memory of the close landmarks. For longer range guidance, the
                  model bee is equipped with an album of snapshots, each taken
                  at a different location within the terrain. Linked to each
                  snapshot is a vector encoding the distance and direction from
                  the place where the snapshot was taken to the hive. When the
                  bee is displaced to a new position, it selects the snapshot
                  which best matches its current image and follows the
                  associated home-vector back to the hive (Fig. 3). Such a
                  hive-centred map can also be used to devise novel routes to
                  places other than the hive. For instance, a bee can reach a
                  foraging site from anywhere in its terrain by adding the
                  home-vector recalled at the starting position to a vector
                  specifying the distance and direction of the foraging site
                  from the hive. The sum of these two vectors defines a direct
                  trajectory to the foraging site.},

                  on building local maps with a local uncertainty representation

                  joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm, which
                  has been successfully used for tracking multiple targets in a
                  cluttered environment, assumes a centralized processing
                  architecture. It assumes that measurements are transmitted to
                  a central site and processed. In some applications, however,
                  it may be desirable for the sensor measurements to be
                  processed at or near the sensors instead of transmitting them
                  to the central processor. The local processed results are then
                  sent over a communication network to be used by other
                  processors. This paper presents a distributed version of the
                  JPDA algorithm which is applicable under such a situation.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents a hybrid approach to the segmentation of
                  range images into planar regions. The term hybrid refers to a
                  combination of edge- and region-based considerations. A
                  reliable computational procedure which takes the range image
                  discontinuities into account is presented for computing the
                  pixel's normal. The segmentation algorithm consists of two
                  parts. In the first one, the pixels are aggregated according
                  to local properties derived from the input data and are
                  represented by a region adjacency graph (RAG). At this stage,
                  the image is still over-segmented. In the second part, the
                  segmentation is refined thanks to the construction of an
                  irregular pyramid. The base of the pyramid is the RAG
                  previously extracted. The over-segmented regions are merged
                  using a surface-based description. This algorithm has been
                  evaluated on 80 real images acquired by two different range
                  sensors using the methodology proposed in (Hoover et al.,
                  1996). Experimental results are presented and compared to
                  others obtained by four research groups},

  abstract =     {We describe an algorithm for reconstructing three-dimensional
                  structure and motion causally, in real time from monocular
                  sequences of images. We prove that the algorithm is minimal
                  and stable, in the sense that the estimation error remains
                  bounded with probability one throughout a sequence of
                  arbitrary length. We discuss a scheme for handling occlusions
                  (point features appearing and disappearing) and drift in the
                  scale factor. These issues are crucial for the algorithm to
                  operate in real time on real scenes. We describe in detail the
                  implementation of the algorithm, which runs on a personal
                  computer and has been made available to the community. We
                  report the performance of our implementation on a few
                  representative long sequences of real and synthetic images.
                  The algorithm, which has been tested extensively over the
                  course of the past few years, exhibits honest performance when
                  the scene contains at least 20-40 points with high contrast,
                  when the relative motion is "slow" compared to the sampling
                  frequency of the frame grabber (30 Hz), and the lens aperture
                  is "large enough" (typically more than 30� of visual field)},

                  navigation using a wheels driven robot equipped with a
                  sonarray (an advanced sonar array). The original mapping
                  navigation experiment, carried out with the same robot
                  configuration, builds a feature map consisting of commonplace
                  indoor landmarks crucial for localisation, namely planes,
                  corners and edges. The map exhaustively maintains covariance
                  matrices among all features, thus presents a time and memory
                  impediment to practical navigation in large environments. The
                  new local mapping strategy proposed here breaks down a large
                  environment into a topology of local regions, only maintaining
                  the covariance among features in the same local region, and
                  the covariance among local maps. This notion of two hierarchy
                  representation drastically improves the memory and processing
                  time requirements of the original global approach, while
                  preserving the statistical details necessary for an accurate
                  map and prolonged navigation. The new local mapping scheme
                  also extends the endeavour towards reducing error accumulation
                  made in the global mapping strategy by eliminating totally
                  error accumulated between visits to the same part of an
                  environment. This is achieved with a map matching strategy
                  developed exclusively for the advanced sonar sensor employed.
                  The local mapping strategy has been tested in large, real life
                  indoor environments and successful results are reported here.},

                  environment is the robot? ability to locate itself on a
                  partially explored map. This becomes challenging when the
                  robot experiences positioning error, does not have an external
                  positioning device, nor the luxury of engineered landmarks
                  placed in its free space. This paper presents a new method for
                  simultaneous localization and mapping that exploits the
                  topology of the robot? free space to localize the robot on a
                  partially constructed map. The topology of the environment is
                  encoded in a topological map; the particular topological map
                  used in this paper is the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG),
                  which also encodes some metric information about the robot?
                  environment, as well. In this paper, we present the low-level
                  control laws that generate the GVG edges and nodes, thereby
                  allowing for exploration of an unknown space. With these
                  prescribed control laws, the GVG (or other topological map)
                  can be viewed as an arbitrator for a hybrid control system
                  that determines when to invoke a particular low-level
                  controller from a set of controllers all working toward the
                  high-level capability of mobile robot exploration. The main
                  contribution, however, is using the graph structure of the
                  GVG, via a graph matching process, to localize the robot.

                  address a broader spectrum of issues than has been previously
                  attempted in a single model. Rather than examining way-finding
                  as a process separate from the rest of cognition, one or the
                  fundamental goals of this work is to examine how the
                  wayfinding process is integrated into general cognition. One
                  result of this approach is that the model is ?eads-up? or
                  scene-based, because it takes advantage of the properties of
                  the human visual system and, particularly, the visual system's
                  split into two pathways. The emphasis on the human location or
                  ?here?system is new to cognitive mapping and is port of an
                  attempt to synthesize prototype theory, associative networks
                  and location together in a connectionist system. Not all of
                  PLAN is new, however. Many of its parts have analogues in one
                  or another preexisting theory. What makes PLAN unique is
                  integrating the various components into a coherent whole, and
                  the capacity of this resulting system to speak to a wide range
                  of constraints. Our approach emphasizes adaptiveness; thus,
                  our focus on such issues as ease of use and efficiency of
                  learning. The result is a model that has a stronger
                  relationship both to the environment, and to the ways that
                  humans interact with it, compared with previous models. The
                  resulting model is examined in some detail and compared to
                  other systems.},

                  framework to identify the hardness of the problem is really
                  interesting. The analysis on the limit (Bayes error rate)
                  w.r.t. various factors are indeed really interesting, and
                  provides a lot of insights into how the problems should be
                  dealt with, and also clearly provides the direction for future
                  research direction. For example, the authors state that the
                  sequential data alone will not be enough alone for learning
                  since the Bayes error rate can not be adjusted anyway, and
                  provides insight that addition of features would be necessary.
                  A similar direction of research on the analytical studies on
                  the labeling problem would be indeed interesting too.},

                  used by the brain. .. 1. The Visual World. What we see at any
                  given moment is in general a fully elaborated representation
                  of a visual scene. .. 2. Hierarchical Processing. Signal
                  elaboration proceeds from the various retinal stages, to the
                  LGN, and thence to higher and higher cortical processing
                  stages. .. 3. Dependency Relations. Higher levels in the
                  processing hierarchy depend on lower levels, but not, in
                  general, vice versa. .. Note finally that the caricature, and,
                  most especially, the "visual world" assumption of the
                  caricature, gets compelling endorsement from common sense. ..
                  We conjecture that the undeniable feeling of having whole
                  scene visual representation is the result mainly of (1)
                  repeated visual visits to stimuli in the scene, (2) short-term
                  semantic memory on the order of a few seconds that maintains
                  the general sense of what is going on without creating and
                  maintaining the point-by-point detail, (3) the brain's
                  "objectification" of sensory perception such that a signal
                  processed in cortex is represented as being about an object in
                  space. .. In any event, it may be worth trying to rethink and
                  reinterpret many physiological and anatomical results under
                  the auspices of the idea that perception is driven by the need
                  to learn action sequences to be performed in space and time.},
  r-findlay04cb ={Our understanding of these processes has progressed to the
                  point where vision is often described as a flagship topic
                  within neuroscience. Nevertheless, the great majority of
                  studies contributing to this tradition involve a passive
                  observer, thus neglecting the continuous and sequential nature
                  of visual activity. The need for a different perspective was
                  given impetus by a recent provocative paper, entitled ?

                  a name frequently used for the new approach, and the questions

                  multi-sensory system to deal with the navigation of a robot in
                  an a priori unknown environment, including (1) the incremental
                  construction of a landmark-based model, and the use of these
                  landmarks for (2) the 3-D localization of the mobile robot and
                  for (3) a sesnor-based navigation mode. For robot
                  localization, a slow process and a fast one are simultaneously
                  executed during the robot motions. In the Modeling process
                  (currently 0.1 Hz), the global landmark-based model is
                  incrementally built and the robot situation can be estimated
                  from discriminant landmarks selected amongst the detected
                  objects in the range data. In the tracking process (currently
                  4 Hz), selected landmarks are tracked in the visual data; the
                  tracking results are used to simplify the matching between
                  landmarks in the modeling process. Finally, a sensor-based
                  visual navigation mode, based on the same landmark selection
                  and tracking, is also presented; in order to navigate during a
                  long robot motion, different landmarks (targets) can be
                  selected as a sequence of sub-goals that the robot must

                  uncalibrated images of architectural scenes. We propose a
                  simple, geometrically intuitive method which exploits the
                  strong rigidity constraints of parallelism and orthogonality
                  present in indoor and outdoor architectural scenes. We show
                  how these simple constraints can be used to calibrate the
                  cameras and to recover the projection matrices for each
                  viewpoint. The projection matrices are used to recover partial
                  3D models of the scene and these can be used to visualise new
                  viewpoints. Our approach does not need any a priori
                  information about the cameras being used. A working system
                  called PhotoBuilder had been designed and implemented to allow
                  a user to interactively build a VRML model of a building from

                  scene. More specifically, From these projection matrices, we
                  can determine the epipolar geometry to help find more point
                  correspondences and then the 3D point positions. These points
                  are then used in association with an image point triangulation
                  to obtain 3D structure. This structure is rendered afterwards
                  using a standard texture mapping procedure and the final model

                  permits efficient and accurate representation of un- certainty
                  during undelayed initialization and beyond, all within the
                  standard extended Kalman filter (EKF). The key concept is
                  direct parametrization of the inverse depth of features rela-
                  tive to the camera locations from which they were first
                  viewed, which produces measurement equations with a high
                  degree of linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope
                  with features over a huge range of depths, even those that are
                  so far from the cam- era that they present little parallax
                  during motion---maintaining sufficient representative
                  uncertainty that these points retain the op- portunity to
                  ``come in'' smoothly from infinity if the camera makes larger
                  movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in the sense
                  that even distant features are immediately used to improve
                  cam- era motion estimates, acting initially as bearing
                  references but not permanently labeled as such. The inverse
                  depth parametrization remains well behaved for features at all
                  stages of SLAM process- ing, but has the drawback in
                  computational terms that each point is represented by a 6-D
                  state vector as opposed to the standard three of a Euclidean
                  XYZ representation. We show that once the depth estimate of a
                  feature is sufficiently accurate, its representation can
                  safely be converted to the Euclidean XYZ form, and propose a
                  linearity index that allows automatic detection and conversion
                  to maintain maximum efficiency---only low parallax features
                  need be maintained in inverse depth form for long periods. We
                  present a real-time implementation at 30 Hz, where the
                  parametrization is validated in a fully automatic 3-D SLAM
                  system featuring a hand- held single camera with no additional
                  sensing. Experiments show robust operation in challenging

                  sensor, which is able to build outdoor, closed-loop maps much
                  larger than previously achieved with such input. Our system,
                  based on the Hierarchical Map approach by Estrada et al.
                  (2005), builds independent local maps in real-time using the
                  EKF-SLAM technique and the inverse depth representation
                  proposed by Montiel et al. (2006). The main novelty in the
                  local mapping process is the use of a data association
                  technique that greatly improves its robustness in dynamic and
                  complex environments. A new visual map matching algorithm
                  stitches these maps together and is able to detect large loops
                  automatically, taking into account the unobservability of
                  scale intrinsic to pure monocular SLAM. The loop closing
                  constraint is applied at the upper level of the Hierarchical
                  Map in near real-time. We present experimental results
                  demonstrating monocular SLAM as a human carries a camera over
                  long walked trajectories in outdoor areas with people and
                  other clutter, even in the more difficult case of
                  forward-looking camera, and show the closing of loops of

                  cooperation of an omnidirectional vision system composed of a
                  conical mirror and a CCD camera and a low cost panoramic range
                  finder system is reported. These two sensors, which have been
                  used independently until now, provide some complementary data.
                  This association enables us to build a robust sensorial model
                  which integrates an important number of significant
                  primitives. We can thus realize an absolute localization of
                  the mobile robot in particular configurations, like symmetric
                  environments, where it is not possible to determine the
                  position with the use of only one of the two sensors. In a
                  first part, we present our global perception system. In a
                  second part, we describe our sensorial model building
                  approach. Finally we present an absolute localization method
                  which uses three matching criteria fused thanks to the
                  combination rules of the Dempster-Shafer theory. The basic
                  probability assignment got for each primitive matching enables
                  to estimate the reliability of the localization. We test our
                  global absolute localization system on several robots'
                  elementary moves in an indoor and symmetric environment},

                  a navigator that has to reach an initially unknown target
                  location and a set of cartographers that randomly move through
                  the environment to nd the target location. When a robot
                  discovers the goal point, the location is communicated among
                  the cartographers to the navigation robot which then starts to
                  move to that location. In extensive experiments, the author

                  an acceptable level of confidence quite fast. Evidence for
                  this could be seen from a long term experiment described in
                  \citet{Golledge97book}. This study addressed the metric

                  the spatial layout of the cognitive map has been reconstructed
                  using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm. The learning

                  improved using vision-based techniques able to extract, manage
                  and track objects in the scene. However, problems arise due to
                  shadows. In particular, moving shadows can affect the correct
                  localization, measurements and detection of moving objects.
                  This work aims to present a technique for shadow detection and
                  suppression used in a system for moving visual object
                  detection and tracking. The major novelty of the shadow
                  detection technique is the analysis carried out in the HSV
                  color space to improve the accuracy in detecting shadows.
                  Signal processing and optic motivations of the approach
                  proposed are described. The integration and exploitation of
                  the shadow detection mod- ule into the system are outlined and

                  object detection in videos in many applications, such as
                  traffic monitoring, human motion capture, and video
                  surveillance. How to correctly and efficiently model and
                  update the background model and how to deal with shadows are
                  two of the most distinguishing and challenging aspects of such
                  approaches. This work proposes a general-purpose method that
                  combines statistical assumptions with the object- level
                  knowledge of moving objects, apparent objects (ghosts), and
                  shadows acquired in the processing of the previous frames.
                  Pixels belonging to moving objects, ghosts, and shadows are
                  processed differently in order to supply an object-based
                  selective update. The proposed approach exploits color
                  information for both background subtraction and shadow
                  detection to improve object segmentation and background
                  update. The approach proves fast, flexible, and precise in

                  of recognizing places based on their appearance. The system we
                  present is not limited to localization, but can determine that
                  a new observation comes from a previously unseen place, and so
                  augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM system in the
                  space of appearance. Our probabilistic approach allows us to
                  explicitly account for perceptual aliasing in the
                  environment--identical but indistinctive observations receive
                  a low probability of having come from the same place. We
                  achieve this by learning a generative model of place
                  appearance. By partitioning the learning problem into two
                  parts, new place models can be learned online from only a
                  single observation of a place. The algorithm complexity is
                  linear in the number of places in the map, and is particularly
                  suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics.

                  involves the solution of large systems of linear algebraic
                  equations with sparse, structured, symmetric coefficient
                  matrices. There is a direct correspondence between the
                  structure of the coefficient matrix, called the stiffness
                  matrix in this case, and the structure of the spatial network
                  delineating the element layout. For the efficient solution of
                  these systems of equations, it is desirable to have an
                  automatic nodal numbering (or renumbering) scheme to ensure
                  that the corresponding coefficient matrix will have a narrow
                  bandwidth. This is the problem considered by R. Rosen I. A
                  direct method of obtaining such a numbering scheme is

                  environment while simultaneously having to determine its
                  location within that map, is one of the current fundamental
                  challenges of robotics. Although a great deal of success has
                  been achieved with laser range finders as sensors and a planar
                  world assumption, low-cost commercial robots will benefit from
                  robust SLAM using cameras only. Towards the goal of a robust,
                  six degree-of-freedom, vision-based SLAM algorithm, we
                  describe the application of "FastSLAM" [1] to the problem of
                  estimating a map from observations of 3D line segments using a
                  trinocular stereo camera rig. By maintaining not only multiple
                  hypotheses about the robot's position in space, but also
                  maintaining multiple maps corresponding to those possible
                  position hypothesis, the algorithm has the potential to
                  overcome the systematic map errors induced by incorrect
                  correspondence estimation.},

  abstract =     {We introduce an any-space algorithm for exact inference in
                  Bayesian networks, called recursive conditioning. On one
                  extreme, recursive conditioning takes O(n) space and
                  O(nexp(wlogn)) time - where n is the size of a Bayesian
                  network and w is the width of a given elimination order -
                  therefore, establishing a new complexity result for
                  linear-space inference in Bayesian networks. On the other
                  extreme, recursive conditioning takes O(nexp(w)) space and
                  O(nexp(w)) time, therefore, matching the complexity of
                  state-of-the-art algorithms based on clustering and
                  elimination. In between linear and exponential space,
                  recursive conditioning can utilize memory at increments of
                  X-bytes, where X is the number of bytes needed to store a
                  floating point number in a cache. Moreover, the algorithm is
                  equipped with a formula for computing its average running time
                  under any amount of space, hence, providing a valuable tool
                  for time-space tradeoffs in demanding applications. Recursive
                  conditioning is therefore the first algorithm for exact
                  inference in Bayesian networks to offer a smooth tradeoff
                  between time and space, and to explicate a smooth,
                  quantitative relationship between these two important
                  resources.},

  abstract =     {This paper demonstrates an approach which exploits an active
                  camera as a projective pointing mechanism. The optical centre
                  of a static camera is notionally substituted by the centre of
                  rotation of the active camera, as is the image plane by a
                  frontal plane, a plane perpendicular to the optical axis of
                  the active camera in its resting direction. Algorithms devised
                  for 3D motion and 3D structure recovery using a single passive
                  camera become immediately applicable to the active camera
                  without need for reformulation. Furthermore, because the
                  active camera can access a panoramic field of view,
                  instabilities which may arise when the field of view is small,
                  or because the shared field of view between successive views
                  after movement is small, are lessened. Two quite different
                  applications of the idea are presented. In the first, the
                  homography between a planar surface in the scene and the
                  frontal plane is recovered and used to recover scene
                  trajectories. In the second, the essential matrix between
                  points in two frontal-plane "views" is recovered and used to
                  determine the motion of a mobile vehicle.},

                  motion of the platform. As they admit, this is not advocated
                  as a practical navigation method.},

                  mobile robots has focused on the simplified case in which a
                  robot is considered to move in two dimensions on a ground
                  plane. While this is often a good approximation, a large

                  around terrain which has significant slopes and undulations,
                  and it is desirable that these robots too should be able to
                  estimate their locations by building maps of natural features.

                  implementation, our robot observes visual point features using

                  through general, unknown scenes becomes a much more
                  challenging problem when real-time performance is required
                  rather than under the off-line processing conditions under
                  which most successful structure from motion work has been
                  achieved. This task of estimating camera motion from
                  measurements of a continuously expanding set of selfmapped
                  visual features is one of a class of problems known as
                  Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) in the robotics
                  community, and we argue that such real-time mapping research,
                  despite rarely being camera-based, is more relevant here than
                  off-line structure from motion methods due to the more
                  fundamental emphasis placed on propagation of uncertainty. We
                  present a top-down Bayesian framework for singlecamera
                  localisation via mapping of a sparse set of natural features
                  using motion modelling and an informationguided active

                  sampling approach. Real-time handling of uncertainty permits
                  robust localisation via the creating and active measurement of
                  a sparse map of landmarks such that regions can be re-visited
                  after periods of neglect and localisation can continue through
                  periods when few features are visible. Results are presented

                  generated on-the-fly as the motion of the camera is

                  the annotation of the scene with rigidly-registered graphics,
                  but further it permits automatic control of the robot? active

                  and therefore on the detailed measurements which will be
                  obtained. While such priors are commonly combined with the
                  actual measurements via Bayes?rule to calculate posterior
                  probability distributions on model parameters, their
                  additional value in guiding efficient image processing has
                  almost always been overlooked. Priors tell us where to look
                  for information in an image, how much computational effort we
                  can expect to expend to extract it, and of how much utility to
                  the task in hand it is likely to be. Such considerations are
                  of importance in all practical real-time vision systems, where
                  the processing resources available at each frame in a sequence
                  are strictly limited ?and it is exactly in high frame-rate
                  real-time systems such as trackers where strong priors are
                  most likely to be available. In this paper, we use Shannon
                  information theory to analyse the fundamental value of

                  of bits, specifically looking at the overwhelming case where
                  uncertainty can be characterised by Gaussian probability
                  distributions. We then compare these measurement values with
                  the computational cost of the image processing required to
                  obtain them. This theory puts on a firm footing for the first

  abstract =     {We present a real-time algorithm which can recover the 3D
                  trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a
                  previously unknown scene. Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM,
                  is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology
                  from mobile robotics to the ?ure vision?domain of a single
                  uncontrolled camera, achieving real-time but drift-free
                  performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches.
                  The core of the approach is the on-line creation of a sparse
                  but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic
                  framework. Our key novel contributions include an active
                  approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general
                  motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for
                  monocular feature initialization and feature orientation
                  estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient
                  and robust algorithm which runs at 30Hz with standard PC and
                  camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic
                  systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens
                  up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time
                  3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size
                  humanoid robot, and live augmented reality with a hand-held
                  camera.},
  c-kaess =      {Good summary of Davison's work, with an application on a
                  humanoid robot. The goal is long-term, repeatable localization
                  within restricted volumes, based on cheap hardware, ie. only
                  one camera. Shi and Tomasi features from monochrome images, no
                  invariant features, but active search for speed (30 Hz), which
                  chooses the features that provide most information while
                  predicting their measurement to restrict the search region.
                  Uses relatively large templates, that are warped full
                  projectively during the prediction, combined with normalized
                  cross-correlation. Based on a wide-angle camera (100 degrees
                  FOV), only a small number of features (around 12) need to be
                  matched in each frame, to update an EKF based map with a
                  maximum of 100 landmarks. Bad features are pruned, new
                  features initialized by placing samples along a line - only
                  the depth is updated in the next steps, while unsupported
                  samples get pruned - assumes sideways motion, to provide
                  sufficient parallax. Templates are not updated over time to
                  prevent drift. Start-up requires a known target placed in
                  front of the camera. Claims that natural selection over time
                  leads to a map of stable, static, widely-observable point

                  problematic because appearance can vary widely depending on
                  illumination, viewing distance, angle of view and so on.
                  Storing a separate image or `template' for every possible view
                  requires vast numbers to be stored and scanned, has a high
                  probability of recognition error and appears not to be the
                  solution adopted by primates. However, some invertebrate
                  template matching systems can achieve recognition by `active
                  vision' in which the animal's own behaviour is used to achieve
                  a fit between template and object, for example by repeatedly
                  following a set path. Recognition is thus limited to views
                  from the set path but achieved with a minimal number of
                  templates. Here we report the first evidence of similar active
                  vision in a bird, in the form of locomotion and individually
                  distinct head movements that give the eyes a similar series of
                  views on different occasions. The hens' ability to recognize
                  objects is also found to decrease when their normal paths are

  abstract =     {This article presents a class of approximation algorithms that
                  extend the idea of bounded-complexity inference, inspired by
                  successful constraint propagation algorithms, to probabilistic
                  inference and combinatorial optimization. The idea is to bound
                  the dimensionality of dependencies created by inference
                  algorithms. This yields a parameterized scheme, called
                  mini-buckets, that offers adjustable trade-off between
                  accuracy and efficiency. The mini-bucket approach to
                  optimization problems, such as finding the most probable
                  explanation (MPE) in Bayesian networks, generates both an
                  approximate solution and bounds on the solution quality. We
                  present empirical results demonstrating successful performance
                  of the proposed approximation scheme for the MPE task, both on
                  randomly generated problems and on realistic domains such as
                  medical diagnosis and probabilistic decoding.},

                  traditional (OR) search space view, the AND/OR search tree
                  displays some of the independencies present in the graphical
                  model explicitly and may sometimes reduce the search space
                  exponentially. Indeed, most algorithmic advances in
                  search-based constraint processing and probabilistic inference
                  can be viewed as searching an AND/OR search tree or graph.
                  Familiar parameters such as the depth of a spanning tree,
                  treewidth and pathwidth are shown to play a key role in
                  characterizing the effect of AND/OR search graphs vs. the

                  directional-resolution for propositional satisfiability,
                  adaptive-consistency for constraint satisfaction, Fourier and
                  Gaussian elimination for solving linear equalities and
                  inequalities, and dynamic programming for combinatorial
                  optimization, can all be accommodated within the bucket
                  elimination framework. Many probabilistic in- ference tasks
                  can likewise be expressed as bucket-elimination algorithms.
                  These include: belief updating, finding the most probable
                  explanation, and expected utility maximization. These
                  algorithms share the same performance guarantees; all are time
                  and space exponential in the induced-width of the problem's
                  interaction graph. While elimination strategies have extensive
                  demands on memory, a contrasting class of algorithms called
                  "conditioning search" require only linear space. Algorithms in
                  this class split a problem into subproblems by instantiating a
                  subset of variables, called a conditioning set, or a cutset.
                  Typical examples of conditioning search algorithms are:
                  backtracking (in constraint satisfaction), and branch and
                  bound (for combinatorial optimization). The paper presents the
                  bucket-elimination framework as a unifying theme across
                  probabilistic and deterministic reasoning tasks and show how
                  conditioning search can be augmented to systematically trade

  abstract =     {QR factorization is most often used as a black box algorithm,
                  but is in fact an elegant computation on a factor graph. By
                  computing a rooted clique tree on this graph, the computation
                  can be parallelized across subtrees, which forms the basis of
                  so-called multifrontal QR methods. By judiciously choosing the
                  order in which variables are eliminated in the clique tree
                  computation, we show that one straightforwardly obtains a
                  method for performing inference in distributed sensor
                  networks. One obvious application is distributed localization
                  and mapping with a team of robots. We phrase the problem as
                  inference on a large-scale Gaussian Markov Random Field
                  induced by the measurement factor graph, and show how
                  multifrontal QR on this graph solves for the global map and
                  all the robot poses in a distributed fashion. The method is
                  illustrated using both small and large-scale simulations, and
                  validated in practice through actual robot experiments.},

                  explore, map, and navigate in a previously unknown
                  environment. We investigate smoothing approaches as a viable
                  alternative to extended Kalman filter-based solutions to the
                  problem. In particular, we look at approaches that factorize
                  either the associated information matrix or the measurement
                  Jacobian into square root form. Such techniques have several
                  significant advantages over the EKF: they are faster yet
                  exact, they can be used in either batch or incremental mode,
                  are better equipped to deal with non-linear process and
                  measurement models, and yield the entire robot trajectory, at
                  lower cost for a large class of SLAM problems. In addition, in
                  an indirect but dramatic way, column ordering heuristics
                  automatically exploit the locality inherent in the geographic
                  nature of the SLAM problem. In this paper we present the
                  theory underlying these methods, along with an interpretation
                  of factorization in terms of the graphical model associated
                  with the SLAM problem. We present both simulation results and
                  actual SLAM experiments in large-scale environments that
                  underscore the potential of these methods as an alternative to
                  EKF-based approaches.},

                  realism of coarse piecewise planar models from an uncalibrated
                  sequence of images. First, dense depth maps are estimated by
                  aligning a planar region of a scene in each image,
                  approximating camera calibration, and generating dense planar
                  parallax. These depth maps are then robustly fused to obtain
                  incrementally refined surface estimates. It is envisaged that
                  this system will extend the modelling capability of existing
                  systems [Cipolla99icmcs] which generate simple, piecewise
                  planar architectural models.},

  abstract =     {The idea of synthesizing bounded length plans by compiling
                  planning problems into a combinatorial substrate, and solving
                  the resulting encodings has become quite popular in recent
                  years. Most work to-date has however concentrated on
                  compilation to satisfiability (SAT) theories and integer
                  linear programming (ILP). In this paper we will show that CSP
                  is a better substrate for the compilation approach, compared
                  to both SAT and ILP. We describe GP-CSP, a system that does
                  planning by automatically converting Graphplan's planning
                  graph into a CSP encoding and solving it using standard CSP
                  solvers. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation of GP-CSP
                  demonstrates that it is superior to both the Blackbox system,
                  which compiles planning graphs into SAT encodings, and an
                  ILP-based planner in a wide range of planning domains. Our
                  results show that CSP encodings outperform SAT encodings in
                  terms of both space and time requirements in various problems.
                  The space reduction is particularly important as it makes
                  GP-CSP less susceptible to the memory blow-up associated with
                  SAT compilation methods. The paper also discusses various
                  techniques in setting up the CSP encodings, planning specific
                  improvements to CSP solvers, and strategies for variable and
                  value selection heuristics for solving the CSP encodings of
                  different types of planning problems.},

                  examples, i.e. why it is easier to search a maze then a graph?
                  or if a robot has a compas how much more powerfull it becomes,

                  (not sensor related). Until know most widely used invariat in
                  kinodynamics was time, i.e most of the cost functions were
                  expressed in terms of time. The conclusions are that
                  communication between agents while searching a maze is
                  equivalent to a single agent with pebbles seraching the maze,
                  i.e. side-effecting the environment has the same complexity as

  abstract =     {The undirected technique for evaluating belief networks
                  [Jensen, et.al., 1990, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988]
                  requires clustering the nodes in the network into a junction
                  tree. In the traditional view, the junction tree is
                  constructed from the cliques of the moralized and triangulated
                  belief network: triangulation is taken to be the primitive
                  concept, the goal towards which any clustering algorithm (e.g.
                  node elimination) is directed. In this paper, we present an
                  alternative conception of clustering, in which clusters and
                  the junction tree property play the role of primitives: given
                  a graph (not a tree) of clusters which obey (a modified
                  version of) the junction tree property, we transform this
                  graph until we have obtained a tree. There are several
                  advantages to this approach: it is much clearer and easier to
                  understand, which is important for humans who are constructing
                  belief networks; it admits a wider range of heuristics which
                  may enable more efficient or superior clustering algorithms;
                  and it serves as the natural basis for an incremental
                  clustering scheme, which we describe.},

                  representing preference profiles and modelling uncertainty
                  distributions. The first setting leads to a valued,
                  noncompensatory generalization of constraint-directed
                  scheduling. The other setting yields a possibility-theoretic
                  counterpart of PERT, where probability distributions of
                  activity durations are changed into possibility distributions,
                  for the purpose of modelling incomplete information. It is
                  pointed out that a special case of the latter, interval-valued
                  PERT, is a difficult, ill-known problem, regarding the
                  determination of critical activities, latest starting times
                  and floats. Lastly when flexible constraints and uncertain
                  processing times are to be jointly considered, the use of
                  possibilistic decision theory leads to the computation of
                  robust schedules.},

  abstract =     {Mobile robots require the ability to build their own maps to
                  operate in unknown environments. A fundamental problem is that
                  odometry-based dead reckoning cannot be used to assign
                  accurate global position information to a map because of drift
                  errors caused by wheel slippage. This paper introduces a fast,
                  on-line method of learning globally consistent maps, using
                  only local metric information. The approach differs from
                  previous work in that it is computationally cheap, easy to
                  implement and is guaranteed to find a globally optimal
                  solution. Experiments are presented in which large, complex
                  environments were successfully mapped by a real robot, and
                  quantitative performance measures are used to assess the
                  quality of the maps obtained.},

                  world, where no distance or orientation metric is assumed of
                  the world. The robot is assumed to be able to autonomously
                  traverse graph edges, recognize when it has reached a vertex,
                  and enumerate edges incident upon the current vertex relative
                  to the edge via which it entered the current vertex. The robot
                  cannot measure distances, and it does not have a compass. It
                  is demonstrated that this exploration problem is unsolvable in
                  general without markers, and, to solve it, the robot is
                  equipped with one or more distinct markers that can be put
                  down or picked up at will and that can be recognized by the
                  robot if they are at the same vertex as the robot. An
                  exploration algorithm is developed and proven correct. Its
                  performance is shown on several example worlds, and heuristics
                  for improving its performance are discussed.},

                  area (MSTd) have previously been shown to respond to the
                  expanding radial motion that occurs as an observer moves
                  through the environment. In previous experiments, MSTd neurons
                  were tested with radial and circular motion centered in the
                  visual field. However, different directions of observer
                  motion, relative to the direction of gaze, are accompanied by
                  visual motion centered at different locations in the visual
                  field. The present experiments investigated whether neurons
                  that respond to radial and circular motion might respond
                  differently when the center of motion was shifted to different
                  regions of the visual field. About 90\% of the 245 neurons
                  studied responded differently when the center of motion was
                  shifted away from the center of the field. The centers of
                  motion preferred by each neuron were limited to one area of
                  the visual field. All parts of the visual field were
                  represented in the sample, with greater numbers of neurons
                  preferring centers of motion closer to the center of the
                  field. We hypothesize that each of the MSTd neurons has a
                  center of motion field with a gradient of preferred centers of
                  motion, and that there is an orderly arrangement of MSTd
                  neurons with each region of the visual field being represented
                  by a set of neurons. This arrangement creates the potential
                  for graded responses from individual neurons for different
                  directions of heading as an observer moves through the

                  of data fusion methods appropriate to networks of
                  decentralised sensors and the practical implementation of
                  these in both civilian and military contexts. The methods
                  employed for studying the decentralized data fusion problem
                  are based on the information-filter formulation of the Kalman
                  filter algorithm and on information-theoretic methods derived
                  from Bayes theorem. This theory is briefly described in
                  context of a number of practical implementations of
                  decentralised data fusion methods in surveillance and control
                  applications. The paper describes specific theoretical tools
                  developed to address such issues as; decentralised
                  communication management, model distribution, decentralised
                  data association and fault detection, sensor control
                  (information gathering, target cuing and hand-off),
                  decentralised picture compilation and map building. Finally,

                  the process by which a mobile robot can build a map of an
                  environment and at the same time use this map to compute it's

                  compelling implementations of SLAM methods. Part I of this
                  tutorial (this paper), describes the probabilistic form of the
                  SLAM problem, essential solution methods and significant
                  implementations. Part II of this tutorial will be concerned

                  fusion problems. This architecture takes the form of a network
                  of sensor nodes, each with its own processing facility, which
                  together do not require any central processor or any central
                  communication facility. In this architecture, computation is
                  performed locally and communication occurs between any two
                  nodes. Such an architecture has many desirable properties,
                  including robustness to sensors failure and flexibility to the
                  addition or loss of one or more sensors. This architecture is
                  appropriate for the class of extended Kalman filter
                  (EKF)-based geometric data fusion problems. The starting point
                  for this architecture is an algorithm which allows the
                  complete decentralization of the multisensor EKF equations
                  among a number of sensing nodes. This algorithm is described,
                  and it is shown how it can be applied to a number of different
                  data-fusion problems. An application of this algorithm to the
                  problem of multicamera, real-time tracking of objects and
                  people moving through a room is described},

                  sleight of hand by having each sensor have its own system

                  really simple in graph terms: there is only a single node of
                  unknowns, connect to a prior factor and several measurement
                  factors. The algorithm simply repeats the information filter
                  at each measurement factor, i.e., the measurement information
                  H'inv(R)H is computed at each node and added to the
                  information matrix I. Then it gets the same quantities
                  (presumably n<m) from the other factors. The state estimate is
                  simply a weighted average. All of this is obfuscated a bit by
                  the cumbersome notation used, i.e., P(k+1|k+1) style.

                  imagined points of observation that are related to their
                  actual position by rotational or translational components.
                  Theoretical issues addressed were whether spatial relations
                  stored in an object-to-object system are directly retrieved or
                  whether retrieval is mediated by a bodycentered coordinate
                  system, and whether body-centered access involves a process of
                  imaging updating of self-position. The results, with those of
                  Rieser (1989), indicate that in the case of regularly
                  structured object arrays, interobject relations are directly
                  retrieved for the translation task, but for the rotation task,

                  experience in outer space travel, it may be capable of seeing
                  the street scene as a reenactment of a series of collisions
                  among rock and ice fragments in a particular cubic kilometer
                  of the Oort cloud on January 1, 0800 hours UTC, 2008 CE, which
                  it happened to have viewed while on a heliopause cruise. ..
                  Note that although the evolution of visual systems may well be
                  driven by their role in supporting action and by their being
                  embodied in active, purposive agents (Noe, 2004), once the
                  system is in place no action is required for it to "just see"
                  (Edelman, 2006). .. [A key realization is that] rather than
                  conceptual, purposive, and interpretation-driven, visual
                  experience, whether rich or impoverished, is representational.
                  As Wittgenstein (1958) noted, "To interpret is to think, to do
                  something; seeing is a state." .. Both the feasibility of and
                  the need for an explicit and sweeping reconstruction of the
                  geometry of the visual world have been subsequently questioned
                  (Aloimonos et al., 1988; Bajcsy, 1988). Noting that biological
                  vision is purposive and active, researchers proposed that
                  computer vision too should aim at serving certain well-defined
                  goals such as navigation or recognition rather than at
                  constructing a general-purpose representation of the world. ..
                  From the computational standpoint, this development amounted
                  to shifting the focus of research from "inverse optics"
                  approaches (Bertero et al., 1988), which aim to recover the
                  solid geometry of the viewed scene, to managing feature-based
                  evidence for task-specific hypotheses about the input (Edelman
                  and Poggio, 1989). .. Anticipating the idea of O'Regan (1992)
                  and O'Regan and Noe (2001) who argued that the world is its
                  own best representation, Reitman et al. (1978, p.72) observed
                  that "The primary function of perception is to keep our
                  internal framework in good registration with that vast
                  external memory, the external environment itself."}

                  Manchester, UK \\ As we move about the world and view objects
                  from different distances and directions, the images projected
                  onto the retina are correspondingly transformed?y translation,
                  magnification, rotation and so on. How, despite rarely
                  experiencing the same image twice, do we recognize an object
                  as being the same? This problem has had a long and varied
                  history involving disparate disciplines: philosophy and
                  psychology; computer science, mathematics, and engineering;
                  anatomy and physiology; and, to a limited extent, neurology.
                  There is still no universally accepted solution. In broad
                  terms, explanatory theories can be divided into two kinds:
                  those that concentrate on the nature of the internal model or
                  representation that the visual system forms of an object in
                  the external world, and those that concentrate on how that
                  representation alters with changes in the pose of the object
                  or changes in observer viewpoint. The two approaches involve a
                  trade-off. Thus, if the representation is assumed to alter
                  with a change in viewpoint, then the visual system needs to
                  apply an internal restoring, interpolating, or normalizing
                  transformation for recognition to occur; and the more work
                  that is done in forming the representation (the more invariant
                  it is to viewpoint changes), the less work that needs to be
                  done in normalizing it. In practice, factors such as the need
                  to retain information about viewpoint changes and whether
                  objects are to be compared simultaneously or sequentially
                  influence the extent of the trade-off. \\ One of the first
                  significant theoretical analyses of visual (and auditory)
                  representation and recognition was undertaken in the 1940s by
                  Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who showed how a biological
                  system could calculate constant properties?nvariants?f entire
                  images under changes in viewpoint. It was not at all clear,
                  however, whether these global invariants could, or should, be
                  computed; moreover, the required biological machinery seemed
                  demanding, and the representations assumed to be produced took
                  little account of the structure of the images presented to the
                  organism. \\ In the decades that followed, a more
                  object-centred approach to the problem of extracting
                  invariants developed. The idea was to associate with each
                  image a `structural description', specifying the configuration
                  of an object's components or local features (e.g. lines and
                  edges) in terms of discrete or qualitative relations between
                  those features (e.g. `joined to', `above', `left of'). Such a
                  description was naturally invariant to translations and
                  magnifications of the image on the retina, and, depending on
                  the choice of relations, to its rotations. \\ A particular
                  structural-description theory of recognition, called
                  `recognition-by-components', has been advocated by Irving
                  Biederman. Here, the object components are generalized cones,
                  derived from contrasts of five edge cues in a two-dimensional
                  image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism and
                  co-termination. Visual detection of these elementary
                  properties is assumed to be invariant over viewing position.
                  Experiments on picture priming, where speed and accuracy of
                  recognition of a briefly presented picture is facilitated by
                  prior presentation, suggested that priming depends on
                  activation of these components. Changes in position, size,
                  orientation-in-depth, or the particular lines and vertices
                  present in the image did not affect the magnitude of the
                  priming, as long as the same generalized-cone components were
                  assumed to be activated. \\ Descriptions of the structure of
                  images based on object parts are appealing because objects are
                  often only part-seen, for example, from the front only, or
                  occluded by other objects. Such descriptions naturally
                  represent non-rigid or articulated objects, for example, a
                  body or hand; and, phenomenologically, they accommodate our
                  experience that objects, such as a cup or a face, are actually
                  perceived as comprising parts. Nevertheless, there has been
                  some debate in the literature about how well object parts can
                  be extracted from images and how well such descriptions
                  account for data on the recognition of novel and familiar
                  objects that have been rotated in depth. \\ An alternative to
                  describing the structure of images in terms of combinations of
                  generic primitive shapes is to describe them in terms of
                  memory records of similar images. One starting point for this
                  theory is that it is unreasonable for a visual system to treat
                  all possible shapes within the same parametric framework:
                  whereas similar shapes may need to be compared in detail, very
                  different shapes need merely to be distinguished from each
                  other. How, then, should similar images be described? For a
                  given class of similar shapes, it is known from statistical
                  pattern-recognition theory that a representation can be
                  obtained in a common space spanned by a small set of reference
                  shapes, generally referred to as basis functions. One way of
                  generating basis functions is to apply the statistical
                  technique of principal-components analysis, which has been
                  used successfully to explain how the visual system
                  approximates a solution to the theoretically simpler problem
                  of surface colour constancy, that is, the constant colour
                  appearance of an object's surface independent of the
                  illuminant on the scene. Another way of generating basis
                  functions from a set of data is to expose an artificial neural
                  network to prototypical examples drawn from that set. \\ In
                  Representation and Recognition in Vision, Shimon Edelman sets
                  out the case for such a network-based scheme called Chorus. In
                  this scheme, vectors of proximities to a small number of
                  prototypes are used to span the representation space. The
                  prototypes are derived from recurring stable patterns of
                  primitive features, which, by definition, correspond to
                  frequently observed objects. Each prototype is represented by
                  an interpolation mechanism similar to a basis-function neural
                  network tuned to several of the object's views, and is learned
                  from examples. \\ The elementary building block of Chorus?
                  unit tuned to a specific view of a specific object?s
                  inherently viewpoint-dependent, but, because the tuning of the
                  individual units is wide (that is, they also respond, usually
                  less well, to views that differ from the optimal), it is
                  possible for a collection of such units to interpolate the
                  entire space of views for a given object. Viewpoint invariance
                  achieved in this way will be approximate and specific for the
                  given object and the degree of viewpoint invariance will
                  decrease when the objects to be discriminated are similar to
                  each other. A system of several object-specific modules of
                  this kind should exhibit some viewpoint invariance for novel
                  objects, by interpolating between the view spaces of the
                  familiar ones. \\ Support for Chorus has come from experiments
                  with synthesized images of abstract, paperclip-like objects
                  and more natural animal-like objects. In one experiment, human
                  subjects were trained to discriminate between computer images
                  selected from classes of monkey-like and dog-like objects.
                  After subjects reached 90\% correct on a fixed canonical view
                  of each object, discrimination performance was tested for
                  novel views that differed by up to 60?from the training view.
                  Despite differing only parametrically, that is, in degree
                  rather than in kind, these objects were recognized virtually
                  independently of viewpoint, providing that the two classes
                  were sufficiently dissimilar. These and the results of other
                  experimental tests were taken as evidence for a theory of
                  recognition by views and against a theory of recognition by
                  components. \\ Which of these two theories is the more
                  appropriate description of human object recognition is
                  unlikely to be resolved by appeals to neurobiology. For
                  example, recordings in macaque temporal cortex have shown
                  specificity for face view and gaze direction, and the extent
                  of any invariance to viewing conditions is limited to about
                  ?0?rotation in depth. These results are certainly consistent
                  with Chorus, but, as Edelman points out, it is possible that
                  the function of the underlying units could be irrelevant to
                  the process of object recognition. \\ Views-based theories
                  suffer from certain foundational problems, as Edelman readily
                  acknowledges. Thus, a principled way needs to be found for
                  defining the set of objects constituting the training set and
                  for dealing with occlusion and interference between the images
                  of neighbouring objects in a scene. There are also some
                  outstanding experimental issues; for example, how to account
                  for psychophysical data showing that shape recognition and
                  discrimination vary systematically with the position of the
                  image on the retina. More critically, there is persistent
                  evidence that small changes in object shape can influence
                  visual perception in a way that seems more naturally explained
                  by components-based theory than by views-based theory. \\ In
                  Representation and Recognition in Vision, Edelman argues
                  strongly for a particular approach to modelling human object
                  recognition, focusing arguments and evidence to that end. It
                  is a stimulating and informative book, but better suited to
                  the sophisticated reader, and rather less so to the beginner
                  hoping to achieve a broad understanding of a sometimes
                  contentious field.}

                  here of four popular and efficient algorithms, each of which
                  computes the translational and rotational components of the
                  transform in closed form, as the solution to a least squares
                  formulation of the problem. They differ in terms of the
                  transformation representation used and the mathematical
                  derivation of the solution, using respectively singular value
                  decomposition or eigensystem computation based on the standard
                  representation, and the eigensystem analysis of matrices
                  derived from unit and dual quaternion forms of the transform.
                  This comparison presents both qualitative and quantitative
                  results of several experiments designed to determine (1) the
                  accuracy and robustness of each algorithm in the presence of
                  different levels of noise, (2) the stability with respect to

                  each approach under different conditions. The results indicate
                  that under �ideal� data conditions (no noise) certain
                  distinctions in accuracy and stability can be seen. But for
                  �typical, real-world� noise levels, there is no difference in

                  moving regions in image sequences taken from a static camera
                  by comparing each new frame to a model of the scene
                  background. We present a novel non-parametric background model
                  and a background subtraction approach. The model can handle
                  situations where the back- ground of the scene is cluttered
                  and not completely static but contains small motions such as
                  tree branches and bushes. The model estimates the probability
                  of observing pixel intensity values based on a sample of
                  intensity values for each pixel. The model adapts quickly to
                  changes in the scene which enables very sensitive detection of
                  moving targets. We also show how the model can use color
                  information to suppress detec- tion of shadows. The
                  implementation of the model runs in real-time for both gray
                  level and color imagery. Evaluation shows that this approach
                  achieves very sensitive detection with very low false alarm

                  problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). One
                  approach to SLAM assumes relatively sparse, relatively
                  unambiguous landmarks and builds a Kalman filter over landmark
                  positions. Other approaches assume dense sensor data which
                  individually are not very distinctive, such as those available
                  from a laser range finder. In earlier work, we presented an
                  algorithm called DP-SLAM, which provided a very accurate
                  solution to the latter case by efficiently maintaining a joint
                  distribution over robot maps and poses. The approach assumed
                  an extremely accurate laser range finder and a deterministic
                  environment. In this work we demonstrate an improved map
                  representation and laser penetration model, an improvement in
                  the asymptotic efficiency of the algorithm, and empirical
                  results of loop closing on a high resolution map of a very

                  (RBPF) for the class of indoor mobile robots equipped only
                  with stereo vision. Our goal is to construct dense metric maps
                  of natural 3D point landmarks for large cyclic environments in
                  the absence of accurate landmark position measurements and
                  motion estimates. Our work differs from other approaches
                  because landmark estimates are derived from stereo vision and
                  motion estimates are based on sparse optical flow. We
                  distinguish between landmarks using the Scale Invariant
                  Feature Transform (SIFT). This is in contrast to current
                  popular approaches that rely on reliable motion models derived
                  from odometric hardware and accurate landmark measurements
                  obtained with laser sensors. Since our approach depends on a
                  particle filter whose main component is the proposal
                  distribution, we develop and evaluate a novel mixture proposal
                  distribution that allows us to robustly close large loops. We
                  validate our approach experimentally for long camera
                  trajectories processing thousands of images at reasonable

                  derived from minimizing the reprojection error (LM+SVD) for
                  two sets of 3D points from two consecutive stereo images. The
                  proposal distribution is a mixture of the standard
                  distribution based on the motion model and a distribution
                  based on the latest observation and learned map (similar to
                  FastSLAM 2.0). The mixing ratio depends on the age of the
                  landmarks, and uses exclusively the standard distribution if
                  no loops are closed. Experimental results are shown for two

                  on robots equipped with stereo vision and develop a SLAM
                  solution based on the theory of the Rao-Blackwellised particle
                  filter (RBPF). We refer to our method as $\sigma$SLAM. We
                  construct maps of 3D point-landmarks identified by their
                  visual appearance. Specifically, we use the Scale Invariant
                  Feature Transform (SIFT) for distinguishing among the
                  thousands of landmarks present in the robot? environment. Our
                  particle filter approach utilizes a mixture proposal
                  distribution and accurately tracks the position of the robot
                  and the landmarks over long trajectories. In addition, we do
                  not depend on robot odometry in the particle filter? proposal
                  mechanism; instead, we develop a proposal distribution that
                  relies on visual odometry easing the transition towards a SLAM
                  solution for robots performing 3D motion. Most importantly,
                  $\sigma$SLAM works in near real-time making it applicable for
                  use with mobile robots today. Moreover, we show that we can
                  construct 2D occupancy-grid maps from stereo vision; these are
                  useful for path planning and obstacle avoidance. Finally, we

                  show, by quantifying the failure rate over long video
                  sequences, that the bundle adjustment is able to significantly
                  decrease the rate of gross failures in the camera tracking.
                  Thus, bundle adjustment does not only bring accuracy
                  improvements. The accuracy improvements also suppress error
                  buildup in a way that is crucial for the performance of the
                  camera tracker. Our experimental study is performed in the
                  setting of tracking the trajectory a calibrated camera moving
                  in 3D for various types of motion, showing that bundle
                  adjustment should be considered an important component for a
                  state-of-the-art real-time camera tracking system.},

                  allows us to obtain accurate metric maps of large environments
                  in real time. The lower (or local) map level is composed of a
                  set of local maps that are guaranteed to be statistically
                  independent. The upper (or global) level is an adjacency graph
                  whose arcs are labeled with the relative location between
                  local maps. An estimation of these relative locations is
                  maintained at this level in a relative stochastic map. We
                  propose a close to optimal loop closing method that, while
                  maintaining independence at the local level, imposes
                  consistency at the global level at a computational cost that
                  is linear with the size of the loop. Experimental results
                  demonstrate the efficiency and precision of the proposed
                  method by mapping the Ada Byron building at our campus. We

                  of our method for larger loops.},
  c-alireza =    {In this paper they build independent local maps, similar to
                  Williams02icra. The reason that the local maps are independent
                  and it is not needed to update the covariance of the other
                  local maps when adding an observation for a particular local
                  map is that, The reference of the local map is the location of
                  first robot pose with complete confidence(zero covariance).
                  This idea is same as Williams02icra. But what makes this paper
                  is different is using the loop closing for improving the
                  relative location of local maps with respect to each other in
                  the global map. They don't use this data to update the local
                  maps, because if so they would have become dependent to each
                  other. The good thing about using the local maps is that since
                  the updates are carried on local data, it reduces the harmful

                  representations of the environment which rely upon
                  scan-matching raw sensor data. Scan-matching raw data results
                  in virtual observations of robot motion with respect to a
                  place its previously been. The exact sparseness of the

                  recent feature based SLAM information algorithms like Sparse
                  Extended Information Filters or Thin Junction Tree Filters.
                  These methods have to make approximations in order to force
                  the feature-based SLAM information matrix to be sparse. The
                  benefit of the exact sparseness of the delayed-state framework
                  is that it allows one to take advantage of the information
                  space parameterization without having to make any
                  approximations. Therefore, it can produce equivalent results

                  Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms which have made
                  substantial progress towards large-area scalability by
                  parameterizing the SLAM posterior within the information
                  (canonical/inverse covariance) form. Of these, probably the
                  most well-known and popular approach is the Sparse Extended

                  empirical testing shows that relative local map relationships
                  are preserved. We then present a slightly modified version of
                  their sparsification procedure which is shown to preserve
                  sparsity while also generating both local and global map
                  estimates comparable to those obtained by the non-sparsified
                  SLAM filter; this modified approximation, however, is no
                  longer constant-time. We demonstrate our findings by benchmark
                  comparison of the modified and original SEIF sparsification
                  rule using simulation in the linear Gaussian SLAM case and
                  real-world experiments for a nonlinear dataset.},

                  localization and mapping (SLAM) information matrix is exactly
                  sparse in a delayed-state framework. Such a framework is used
                  in view-based representations of the environment that rely
                  upon scan-matching raw sensor data to obtain virtual
                  observations of robot motion with respect to a place it has
                  previously been. The exact sparseness of the delayed-state
                  information matrix is in contrast to other recent
                  feature-based SLAM information algorithms, such as sparse
                  extended information filter or thin junction-tree filter,
                  since these methods have to make approximations in order to
                  force the feature-based SLAM information matrix to be sparse.
                  The benefit of the exact sparsity of the delayed-state
                  framework is that it allows one to take advantage of the
                  information space parameterization without incurring any
                  sparse approximation error. Therefore, it can produce
                  equivalent results to the full-covariance solution. The
                  approach is validated experimentally using monocular imagery
                  for two datasets: a test-tank experiment with ground truth,
                  and a remotely operated vehicle survey of the RMS Titanic.},

                  regions. We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for
                  a boundary between two regions using a graph-based
                  representation of the image. We then develop an efficient
                  segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that
                  although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces
                  segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the
                  algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of
                  local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate
                  the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm
                  runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is
                  also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the
                  method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability
                  image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability
                  regions.},

                  unknown environment while concurrently using these maps for
                  navigation. Current algorithms for this concurrent mapping and
                  localization (CML) problem have been implemented for single
                  vehicles, but do not account for extra positional information
                  available when multiple vehicles operate simultaneously.
                  Multiple vehicles have the potential to map an environment
                  more quickly and robustly than a single vehicle. This paper
                  presents a cooperative CML algorithm that merges sensor and
                  navigation information from multiple autonomous vehicles. The
                  algorithm presented is based on stochastic estimation and uses
                  a feature-based approach to extract landmarks from the
                  environment. The theoretical framework for the collaborative
                  CML algorithm is presented, and a convergence theorem central
                  to the cooperative CML problem is proved for the first time.
                  This theorem quanti£es the performance gains of collaboration,
                  allowing for determination of the number of cooperating
                  vehicles required to accomplish a task. A simulated
                  implementation of the collaborative CML algorithm demonstrates
                  substantial performance improvement over non-cooperative CML.},

                  in the environment and automatically detected in digital
                  camera images using an accompanying detection algorithm. They
                  are useful for augmented reality (AR), robot navigation, and
                  general applications where the relative pose between a camera
                  and object is required. Important parameters for such marker
                  systems is their false detection rate (false positive rate),
                  their inter-marker confusion rate, minimal detection size (in
                  pixels) and immunity to lighting variation. ARTag is a marker
                  system that uses digital coding theory to get a very low false
                  positive and inter-marker confusion rate with a small required
                  marker size, employing an edge linking method to give robust
                  lighting variation immunity. ARTag markers are bi-tonal planar
                  patterns containing a unique ID number encoded with robust
                  digital techniques of checksums and forward error correction
                  (FEC). This proposed new system, ARTag has very low and
                  numerically quantifiable error rates, does not require a grey
                  scale threshold as does other marker systems, and can encode
                  up to 2002 different unique ID's with no need to store
                  patterns. Experimental results are shown validating this
                  system.},

  review =       {More than one third of the human brain is devoted to the
                  processes of seeing - vision is after all the main way in
                  which we gather information about the world. But human vision
                  is a dynamic process during which the eyes continually sample
                  the environment. Where most books on vision consider it as a
                  passive activity, this book is unique in focusing on vision as
                  an 'active' process. It goes beyond most accounts of vision
                  where the focus is on seeing, to provide an integrated account
                  of seeing AND looking. The book starts by pointing out the
                  weaknesses in our traditional approaches to vision and the
                  reason we need this new approach. It then gives a thorough
                  description of basic details of the visual and oculomotor
                  systems necessary to understand active vision. The book goes
                  on to show how this approach can give a new perspective on
                  visual attention, and how the approach has progressed in the
                  areas of visual orienting, reading, visual search, scene
                  perception and neuropsychology. Finally, the book summarises
                  progress by showing how this approach sheds new light on the
                  old problem of how we maintain perception of a stable visual
                  world. Written by two leading vision scientists, this book
                  will be valuable for vision researchers and psychology
                  students, from undergraduate level upwards.},

                  desirable property of robustness to data association errors.
                  Another important advantage of our algorithm is that
                  non-linearities are computed exactly, so that global
                  constraints can be imposed even if they result in large shifts
                  to the map. We represent the map as a graph and use the graph
                  to find an efficient map update algorithm. We also show how
                  topological consistency can be imposed on the map, such as,
                  closing a loop. The algorithm has been implemented on an
                  outdoor robot and we have experimental validation of our
                  ideas. We also explain how the graph can be simplified leading
                  to linear approximations of sections of the map. This

                  addresses symmetries and constraints in the feature
                  coordinates. Furthermore, the representation allows for the
                  features to be added to the map with partial initialization.
                  This is an important property when using oriented vision
                  features where angle information can be used before their full
                  pose is known. The number of the dimensions for a feature can
                  grow with time as more information is acquired. At the same
                  time as the special properties of each type of feature are
                  accounted for, the commonalities of all map features are also
                  exploited to allow SLAM algorithms to be interchanged as well

                  coordinates, the measurement subspace, M-space. The graphical
                  method has the advantages of delayed linearizations and soft
                  commitment to feature measurement matching. It also allows
                  large maps to be built up as a network of small local patches,
                  star nodes. This local map net is then easier to work with.
                  The formation of the star nodes is explicitly stable and
                  invariant with all the symmetries of the original
                  measurements. All linearization errors are kept small by using
                  a local frame. The construction of this invariant star is made

                  variable (the number of constraints in which it is involved)
                  is restricted to two, and the degree of a symbol variable is
                  restricted to one. ... Normal realizations have a natural
                  graphical model, which we call a normal graph, in which
                  constraints are represented by vertices, state variables are
                  represented by ordinary edges, and symbol variables are
                  represented by leaf edges ("half-edges"). We show that the
                  normal graph of a normalized generalized state realization has
                  the same topology as the factor graph of the original
                  realization. ... A code is any subset of a symbol

                  problem in mobile robotics. In this paper we present an
                  approach to distributed multi-robot mapping and exploration.
                  Our system enables teams of robots to efciently explore
                  environments from different, unknown locations. In order to
                  ensure consistency when combining their data into shared maps,
                  the robots actively seek to verify their relative locations.
                  Using shared maps, they coordinate their exploration
                  strategies so as to maximize the efciency of exploration. Our
                  system was evaluated under extremely realistic real-world
                  conditions. An outside evaluation team found the system to be
                  highly efcient and robust. The maps generated by our approach
                  are consistently more accurate than those generated by
                  manually measuring the locations and extensions of rooms and
                  objects.},

                  exploration, the extension to multiple robots poses several
                  new challenges, including (1) coordination of robots, (2)
                  integration of information collected by different robots into
                  a consistent map, and (3) dealing with limited
                  communication... Our technique for exploration with unknown
                  start locations integrates robot detections into a Bayesian,
                  decision-theoretic exploration strategy....Similar to
                  [Howard04iser], this is done by using robot detections.
                  However, in contrast to [Howard04iser], these detections are
                  not coincidental; they are pursued actively.}

  abstract =     {In the past decade, a large number of robots has been built
                  that explicitly implement biological navigation behaviours. We
                  review these biomimetic approaches using a framework that
                  allows for a common description of biological and technical
                  navigation behaviour. The review shows that biomimetic systems
                  make significant contributions to two fields of research:
                  First, they provide a real world test of models of biological
                  navigation behaviour; second, they make new navigation
                  mechanisms available for technical applications, most notably
                  in the field of indoor robot navigation. While simpler insect
                  navigation behaviours have been implemented quite
                  successfully, the more complicated way-finding capabilities of
                  vertebrates still pose a challenge to current systems.},

                  organization of Learning, 1990] definition ?avigation is the
                  process of determining and maintaining a course or trajectory
                  to a goal location.?.. The forms of spatial behaviour captured
                  by the above definition fall into two fundamentally different
                  groups: local navigation and way-finding. .. [navigation
                  hierarchy:] Local navigation behaviours are divided into four
                  levels: search, direction-following, aiming and guidance;
                  way-finding behaviours into three levels:
                  recognition-triggered response, topological and survey
                  navigation. .. In computer science, a similar hierarchy has
                  been presented by Kuipers. .. Examples of local navigation
                  mechanisms, recognition- triggered responses and topological
                  navigation can be found throughout the animal kingdom, whereas
                  survey navigation may be limited to vertebrates. .. 4.1.
                  Recognition-triggered response: Insects can associate movement
                  decisions with visual landmarks. Ants, for instance, may learn
                  to always pass a landmark on the right side. .. Bees are able
                  to learn routes, i.e., connected chains of
                  recognition-triggered responses. .. biological systems seem to
                  construct topological representations by integrating routes in
                  a bottom-up manner [38]. This ability has been observed in
                  many animals, ranging from honeybees [16] to humans [21].
                  ..The above described robot systems show that, mostly within
                  the last five years, biomimetic approaches have been developed
                  for most types of biological navigation, with the exception of
                  search and survey navigation. However, the field is still at
                  the beginning of its development. This is documented by the
                  fact that all of the reviewed approaches aim at testing
                  biological models or mechanisms rather than at finding an
                  optimal technical solution to a given problem. .. From the
                  bionic point of view, biomimetic research has yielded a number
                  of interesting new navigation mechanisms. In particular,
                  corridor-following based on optic flow, path integration with
                  a polarization compass, snapshot-based guidance and
                  recognition-triggered responses are now well understood. ..
                  Before a biomimetic survey navigation system can be built, the
                  hurdle of topological navigation has to be taken. Although the
                  principle problems are well understood, there is currently no
                  system that autonomously builds graphs from routes in a larger
                  scale environment. In our opinion, reliable topological
                  navigation could be the challenge of the near future. Once
                  this is achieved, a number of interesting questions concerning
                  survey navigation can be addressed; for instance, how the
                  topological representation should be embedded in a common
                  reference frame, or how much metric information is necessary
                  for this behaviour. A biomimetic robot capable of survey
                  navigation would finally close the loop that began with
                  abandoning the traditional map-based navigation systems.}

                  convergence of previous relaxation methods because it
                  optimizes the map at multiple levels of resolution. The
                  resulting algorithm has an update time that is linear in the

                  a set of variables subject to a set of constraints (relations)
                  on those variables. Backtrack search is often used to solve
                  such problems. A relationship involving the structure of the
                  constraints is described which characterizes to some degree
                  the extreme case of minimum backtracking (none). The
                  relationship involves a concept called "width," which may
                  provide some guidance in the representation of constraint
                  satisfaction problems and the order in which they are
                  searched. The width concept is studied and applied, in
                  particular, to constraints which form tree structures.},

  abstract =     {``Background subtraction'' is an old technique for finding
                  moving objects in a video sequence---for example, cars driving
                  on a freeway. The idea is that subtracting the current image
                  from a time-averaged background image will leave only
                  nonstationary objects. It is, however, a crude approximation
                  to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it
                  fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish
                  shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is
                  that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that
                  pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a
                  mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each pixel using
                  an unsupervised technique---an efficient, incremental version
                  of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this
                  automatically updates the mixture component for each class
                  according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving
                  objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies
                  and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other
                  techniques such as thresholding. Application of this method as
                  part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected
                  to result in significant improvements in vehicle
                  identification and tracking.},

                  level interpretation and localization in complex scenes. In
                  urban environments, recognition of buildings might play a
                  dominant role in robotic systems that need object based
                  navigation, that take advantage of visual feedback and
                  multimodal information for self-localization, or that enable
                  association to related information from the identified
                  semantics. We present a new method "the informative local
                  features approach" based on an information theoretic saliency
                  measure that is rapidly derived from a local Parzen window
                  density estimation in feature subspace. From the learning of a
                  decision tree based mapping to informative features, it
                  enables attentive access to discriminative information and
                  thereby significantly speeds up the recognition process. This
                  approach is highly robust with respect to severe degrees of
                  partial occlusion, noise, and tolerant to some changes in
                  scale and illumination. We present performance evaluation on
                  our publicly available reference object database (TSG-20) that
                  demonstrates the efficiency of this approach, case wise even
                  outperforming the SIFT feature approach. Building recognition

  abstract =     {According to present genetic theory, the fine structure of
                  genes consists of linearly ordered elements. A mutant gene is
                  obtained by alteration of some connected portion of this
                  structure. By examining data obtained from suitable
                  experiments, it can be determined whether or not the blemished
                  portions of two mutant genes intersect or not, and thus
                  intersection data for a large number of mutants can be
                  represented as an undirected graph. If this graph is an
                  "interval graph", then the observed data are consistent with a
                  linear model of the gene. Given a family of sets
                  $S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_n$, one can form the intersection graph of
                  the family by associating a vertex of the graph with each set
                  and joining two distinct vertices with an edge if their
                  corresponding sets have a nonempty intersection. Conversely,
                  any finite graph can, of course, be viewed as the intersection
                  graph of a family of sets (in many ways). If each set can be
                  taken as an interval on the real line, the graph is called an
                  interval graph. The problem of determining when a graph is an
                  interval graph is a special case of the following problem
                  concerning $(0,1)$-matrices: When can the rows of such a
                  matrix be permuted so as to make the 1's in each column appear
                  consecutively? A complete theory is obtained for this latter
                  problem, culminating in a decomposition theorem which leads to
                  a rapid algorithm for deciding the question, and for
                  constructing the desired permutation when one exists.},

                  independent of vertex elimination, and graphs of this class
                  can be characterized by their minimal separators, as shown by
                  Dirac \cite{Dirac61} in 1961. At the same time, they coincide
                  with the class of graphs resulting from Elimination Game, and
                  they can also be characterized through vertex orderings, as
                  shown by Fulkerson and Gross \cite{Fulkerson65pjm} in 1965.}

  abstract =     {This paper proposes a method for the visual-based navigation
                  of a mobile robot in indoor environments, using a single
                  omni-directional (catadioptric) camera. The geometry of the
                  catadioptric sensor and the method used to obtain a bird? eye
                  (orthographic) view of the ground plane are presented. This
                  representation significantly simplifies the solution to
                  navigation problems, by eliminating any perspective effects.
                  The nature of each navigation taskis taken into account when
                  designing the required navigation skills and environmental
                  representations. We propose two main navigation modalities:
                  Topological Navigation and Visual Path Following. Topological
                  Navigation is used for traveling long distances and does not
                  require knowledge of the exact position of the robot but
                  rather, a qualitative position on the topological map. The
                  navigation process combines appearance based methods and
                  visual servoing upon some environmental features. Visual Path
                  Following is required for local, very precise navigation, for
                  e.g. door traversal, docking. The robot is controlled to
                  follow a pre-specified path accurately, by tracking visual
                  landmarks in bird? eye views of the ground plane. By clearly
                  separating the nature of these navigation tasks, a simple and
                  yet powerful navigation system is obtained.},

                  technique in 1973 to solve systems of linear equations [15].
                  His algorithm, termed nested dissection, was later generalized
                  [21] and applied to other problems, such as network
                  reliability [27].},

                  used in solving self-adjoint elliptic boundary value problems.
                  It is assumed that $A$ is symmetric, positive definite, and
                  has a particular zero-nonzero structure associated with such
                  boundary value problems. No further assumptions are made
                  regarding the values of the nonzero elements of $A$. Using a
                  particular ordering, the author shows that $A$ can be factored
                  in $O(n^3)$ operations and that the lower triangular factor
                  must have $O(n^2\ln_2n)$ nonzero components. Since these
                  bounds have been shown by A. J. Hoffman, M. S. Martin and D.
                  J. Rose [same issue] to be lower bounds, it follows that the

                  degree algorithm has received much study, and many important
                  enhancements have been made to it. This paper describes these
                  various enhancements, their historical development, and some
                  experiments showing how very effective they are in improving
                  the execution time of the algorithm. A shortcoming is also
                  presented that exists in all of the widely used
                  implementations of the algorithm, namely, that the quality of
                  the ordering provided by the implementations is surprisingly
                  sensitive to the initial ordering. For example, changing the
                  input ordering can lead to an increase (or decrease) of as
                  much as a factor of three in the cost of the subsequent
                  numerical factorization. This sensitivity is caused by the
                  lack of an effective tie-breaking strategy, and the authors'
                  experiments illustrate the importance of developing such a
                  strategy.},

                  involves novel assumptions about object perception and about
                  what is called 'visual kinaesthesis'. Evidence for these
                  assumptions is cited. On the basis of this theory it is
                  possible to suppose that animals are visually oriented to the
                  surfaces of their environment, not merely to light as such. In
                  short, it is possible to explain why they seem to have space
                  perception. Implications of this approach for maze-learning

                  expected that their loss would be catastrophic. An opportunity

                  proposition in an individual who was born without functional
                  eye muscles. The eyes of this unusual individual are fixed in
                  her head. Surprisingly she is hardly impaired; she reads well
                  and leads a normal life as a university student. At first
                  glance, this might appear to support the traditional approach
                  to studying vision; after all she gets on perfectly well
                  without eye movements. It turns out, however, that in visual
                  tasks she makes head scanning movements with comparable
                  properties to the eye movements of an unimpaired subject. This
                  transfer of the same behaviour from the eyes to the head
                  suggests that active vision processes can be transferred from
                  one motor system to another. Active vision is crucially
                  dependent upon orienting movements, but these do not need to
                  be eye movements.}

                  of fast wide baseline local features, which we developed and
                  used in the novel approach to sparse visual path following
                  described in this paper. These local features have the great
                  advantage that they can be recognized even if the viewpoint
                  differs significantly. This opens the door to a memory
                  efficient description of a path by descriptors of sparse
                  images. We propose a method for re-execution of these paths by
                  a series of visual homing operations which yield a navigation
                  method with unique properties: it is accurate, robust, fast,
                  and without odometry error build-up.},

                  occlusions is the technique of local region matching. ..
                  Related to visual homing is visual ego-motion estimation,
                  which has become possible lately due to increasing available

                  into tree schemas and cyclic schemas. (These are called
                  acyclic hypergraphs and cyclic hypergraphs elsewhere in the
                  literature.) This partition has interesting implications in
                  query processing, dependency theory, and graph theory. The
                  tree/cyclic partitioning of database schemas originated with a
                  similar partition of equijoin queries. Given an arbitrary
                  equijoin query one can obtain an equivalent query that
                  calculates the natural join of all relations in (an
                  efficiently) derived database; such a query is called a
                  natural join (NJ) query. If the derived database is a tree
                  schema the original query is said to be a tree query, and
                  otherwise a cyclic query. In this paper we analyze query
                  processing consequences of the tree/cyclic partitioning. We
                  are able to argue, qualitatively, that queries which imply a
                  tree schema are easier to process than those implying a cyclic
                  schema. Our results also extend the study of the semijoin

                  and analyze the cost of solving CSPs having bounded
                  hypertree-width. We provide a framework for comparing
                  parametric decomposition-based methods according to
                  tractability criteria and compare the most relevant methods.
                  We show that the method of hypertree decomposition dominates
                  the others in the case of general CSPs (i.e., CSPs of
                  unbounded arity). We also make comparisons for the restricted
                  case of binary CSPs. Finally, we consider the application of
                  decomposition methods to the dual graph of a hypergraph. In
                  fact, this technique is often used to exploit binary
                  decomposition methods for nonbinary CSPs. However, even in
                  this case, the hypertree-decomposition method turns out to be
                  the most general method.},

                  fusion center and in which no single sensor node has global
                  knowledge of network topology. An algorlthm is described which
                  is able to locally process and assimilate data in such
                  networks and which yields an identical result to that obtained
                  in a centralized system. An implementation of this
                  decentralized data fusion algorithm on a process control rig
                  incorporating over 150 sensors and 30 processors is described.
                  The results show that the decentralized data fusion system

                  robustness, scalability and flexibility over a centralized

                  likelihood filter. [The log likelihoods] may simply be summed
                  to yield the posterior log-likelihood [which] provides a far
                  more natural method of aggregating data than does the
                  conventional Kalman filter. [Similar data fusion methods] may
                  be applied to cases when the underlying probabilities are not
                  Gaussian, and indeed in cases where the underlying state-space
                  is discrete. These cases lead directly to an information
                  theory approach to data fusion as described in (Manyika and

                  Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM) algorithm.
                  It presents optimal algorithms that consider the special form
                  of the matrices and a new compressed filter that can
                  significantly reduce the computation requirements when working
                  in local areas or with high frequency external sensors. It is
                  shown that by extending the standard Kalman filter models the
                  information gained in a local area can be maintained with a
                  cost O(Na^2), where Na is the number of landmarks in the local
                  area, and then transferred to the overall map in only one
                  iteration at full SLAM computational cost. Additional
                  simplifications are also presented that are very close to
                  optimal when an appropriate map representation is used.
                  Finally the algorithms are validated with experimental results
                  obtained with a standard vehicle running in a completely
                  unstructured outdoor environment.},

                  vector for a local map is updated and the updating of the
                  global map is postponed until going to another submap. update
                  of the local map state is O(N_a^2) where N_a is the number of
                  features in the local map. In cases that the robot traverses
                  in a local map for a long time or N_a is much less than the
                  total number of features in the global map and at the same
                  time the features are visited with a high frequency, their
                  algorithm is very useful. Their solution is an exact solution,
                  however, they also introduce an approximate O(n) solution in
                  their paper as well.},

                  resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models

  abstract =     {Mobile robots can use geometric or topological maps of their
                  environment to navigate reliably. Automatic creation of such
                  maps is still an unrealized goal, especially in environments
                  that have large cyclical structures. Drawing on recent
                  techniques of global registration and correlation, we present
                  a method, called Local Registration and Global Correlation
                  (LRGC), for reliable reconstruction of consistent global maps
                  from dense range data. The method is attractive because it is
                  incremental, producing an updated map with every new sensor
                  input; and runs in constant time independent of the size of
                  the map (except when closing large cycles). A real-time
                  implementation and results are presented for several indoor
                  environments.}

                  conditional probabilities estimated from the cooccurrence
                  matrices, and boundary information via conditional
                  probabilities which are determined a priori. The method
                  robustly segments an image into homogeneous areas and
                  generates an edge map. The technique extends easily to general
                  edge operators. An example is given for the Canny operator.

  abstract =     {The ability to learn a consistent model of its environment is
                  a prerequisite for autonomous mobile robots. A particularly
                  challenging problem in acquiring environment maps is that of
                  closing loops; loops in the environment create challenging
                  data association problems [9]. This paper presents a novel
                  algorithm that combines Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering
                  and scan matching. In our approach scan matching is used for
                  minimizing odometric errors during mapping. A probabilistic
                  model of the residual errors of scan matching process is then
                  used for the resampling steps. This way the number of samples
                  required is seriously reduced. Simultaneously we reduce the
                  particle depletion problem that typically prevents the robot
                  from closing large loops. We present extensive experiments
                  that illustrate the superior performance of our approach
                  compared to previous approaches.},

  abstract =     {The problem of generating maps with mobile robots has received
                  considerable attention over the past years. Most of the
                  techniques developed so far have been designed for situations
                  in which the environment is static during the mapping process.
                  Dynamic objects, however, can lead to serious errors in the
                  resulting maps such as spurious objects or misalignments due
                  to localization errors. In this paper we consider the problem
                  of creating maps with mobile robots in dynamic environments.
                  We present a new approach that interleaves mapping and
                  localization with a probabilistic technique to identify
                  spurious measurements. In several experiments we demonstrate
                  that our algorithm generates accurate 2d and 3d in different
                  kinds of dynamic indoor and outdoor environments. We also use
                  our algorithm to isolate the dynamic objects and to generate
                  three-dimensional representation of them.},

                  with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral trriangles

                  three different ISIs, 50 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000 ms. Heading

  abstract =     {Density-based modeling of visual features is very common in
                  computer vision, either by using non-parametric techniques or
                  through representing the underlying density function as a
                  weighted sum of Gaussians. A number of real-time tasks such as
                  background modeling or modeling the appearance of a moving
                  target require sequential density estimation, where new data
                  is incorporated in the model as it becomes available.
                  Nevertheless, current methods for updating the density
                  function either lack flexibility, by fixing the number of
                  Gaussians in the mixture, or require large memory amounts, by
                  maintaining a non-parametric representation of the den- sity.
                  This paper presents an efficient method for recursive density
                  approximation that relies on the propagation of the density
                  modes. At each time step, the modes of the density are
                  re-estimated and a Gaussian component is assigned to each
                  mode. The covariance of each component is derived from the
                  Hessian matrix estimated at the mode location. To detect the
                  modes we employ the variable-bandwidth mean shift. While the
                  proposed density representation is memory efficient (which is
                  typical for mixture densities), it inherits the flexibility of
                  non-parametric methods, by allowing the number of modes to
                  adapt in time. We show that the same mode propagation
                  principle applies for subspaces derived from eigen analysis.
                  Extensive experimental background modeling results demonstrate
                  the performance of the method.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents the case for a functional account of
                  vision. A variety of studies have consistently revealed ?hange
                  blindness?or insensitivity to changes in the visual scene
                  during an eye movement. These studies indicate that only a
                  small part of the information in the scene is represented in
                  the brain from moment to moment. It is still unclear, however,
                  exactly what is included in visual representations. This paper
                  reviews experiments using an extended visuo-motor task,
                  showing that display changes affect performance differently
                  depending on the observer? place in the task. These effects
                  are revealed by increases in fixation duration following a
                  change. Different task-dependent increases suggest that the
                  visual system represents only the information that is
                  necessary for the immediate visual task. This allows a
                  principled exploration of the stimulus properties that are
                  included in the internal visual representation. The task
                  specificity also has a more general implication that vision
                  should be conceptualized as an active process executing
                  special purpose ?outines?that compute only the currently
                  necessary information. Evidence for this view and its
                  implications for visual representations are discussed.
                  Comparison of the change blindness phenomenon and fixation
                  durations shows that conscious report does not reveal the

                  There appears to be little room for other functions.
                  Performance is also highly serialized. .. Another compelling
                  feature of the behaviour was the similarity between subjects.
                  .. The crucial advantage of task-specific routines is
                  computational efficiency. .. In the case of human vision the
                  retinal image is changing every several hundred milliseconds
                  as the observer changes gaze. Thus, the relevant information
                  must be extracted very quickly. .. Direction of gaze can be
                  used to specify the location of the needed information in the
                  visual scene and the time when it is needed. This makes
                  complex internal representations unnecessary because the
                  observer/autonomous system can acquire the necessary
                  information from the scene during performance of the task,
                  rather than using the information inherent in an internal
                  model. .. The computational advantage of task specific
                  representations comes at a cost. A crucial problem for any
                  system like this is: How are more complex behaviours composed
                  using the individual routines? That is, how is the scheduling
                  of the individual routines handled? .. What, then, can we
                  conclude about the content of visual representations from the
                  change blindness work and the results described here? [] The
                  general consensus [] is that the visual information retained
                  after a change in fixation position is very limited.}

                  movements in cognitive function. The first is the

                  of the role of internal reward in guiding eye and body
                  movements, revealed especially in neurophysiological studies.
                  The third important advance has been the theoretical
                  developments in the fields of reinforcement learning and
                  graphic simulation. All of these advances are proving crucial

                  rewardbased systems that incorporate realistic models of eye
                  movements over extended time scales. This has shifted the
                  focus of experimental understanding from where in a scene the
                  eyes fixate in an image, to why the eyes choose a location in
                  a scene, and when they choose it. .. The most novel finding of
                  task-oriented studies is that the eyes are positioned at a
                  point that is not the most visually salient, but is the best
                  for the spatio-temporal demands of the job that needs to be
                  done. This line of investigation has been used in extended
                  visuo-motor tasks such as driving, walking, sports, and making
                  tea or sandwiches[]. .. Not only is the sequence of fixations
                  tightly linked to the task, but in addition, fixations appear
                  to have the purpose of obtaining quite specific information.
                  .. In driving, Shinoda et al. [42] showed that approximately
                  45\% of fixations fell close to intersections. As a
                  consequence of this, subjects were more likely to notice
                  ?top?signs located at intersections as opposed to signs in the
                  middle of a block, suggesting in turn that subjects have
                  learnt that traffic signs are more likely around
                  intersections. .. The value of VR is that it allows the
                  creation of human models that implement complex visuo-motor
                  loops for the control of temporally extended behaviors. .. One
                  of the principal findings of these simulations is that the
                  informationfromfixations supports behavior indifferent ways.
                  In this respect is very helpful to think of the visual
                  computations that need to be done as hierarchically organized,
                  a viewpoint that has not been as obvious from the
                  attention/working-memory dichotomy. Table 1 shows the basic
                  elements of a representative hierarchy that has three levels
                  ?Behavior, Arbitration and Context ?highlighting the different
                  roles of vision at each level. .. The mental programs that
                  drive gaze selection are increasingly seen to be
                  reward-based.}

                  is called a minimal triangulation of $G$ if no triangulation

                  presenting algorithms to compute any minimal triangulation of
                  the input graph appeared in 1976, several characterizations of
                  minimal triangulations of a graph have been established; among
                  those, a close relationship between minimal triangulations of
                  a graph and its minimal separators has been exhibited. A
                  variety of algorithms to compute any minimal triangulation of
                  the input graph has been obtained both for general graphs and
                  for restricted graph classes. The survey presents and ties
                  together in a unified way, both graph-theoretic and
                  algorithmic results concerning minimal triangulations.}

                  infer the orderings of application objects, thereby implicitly
                  enumerating a finite solution space. The formalism is broad

                  programming and branch and bound to problems with
                  nonassociative objects, and can model both oblivious and
                  nonoblivious algorithms, as well as parallel algorithms. The
                  model is used to classify computations based, in part, on the
                  types of computationally feasible dominances that they employ.
                  It is demonstrated that the model is computationally precise

                  still pose considerable challenges in the application of range
                  sensors in the context of robotic navigation, especially in
                  the implementation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping
                  (SLAM) with sparse features. This paper presents a combination
                  of methods in solving the SLAM problem in a constricted indoor
                  environment using small baseline stereo vision. Main
                  contributions include a feature selection and tracking
                  algorithm, a stereo noise filter, a robust feature validation
                  algorithm and a multiple hypotheses adaptive window
                  positioning method in "closing the loop". These methods take a
                  novel approach in that information from the image processing
                  and robotic navigation domains are used in tandem to augment
                  each other. Experimental results including a real-time
                  implementation in an office-like environment are also
                  presented.},

  abstract =     {Camera motion estimation is useful for a range of
                  applications. Usually, feature tracking is performed through
                  the sequence of images to determine correspondences.
                  Furthermore, robust statistical techniques are normally used
                  to handle large number of outliers in correspondences. This
                  paper proposes a new method that avoids both. Motion is
                  calculated between two consecutive stereo images without any
                  pre-knowledge or prediction about feature location or the
                  possibly large camera movement. This permits a lower frame
                  rate and almost arbitrary movements. Euclidean constraints are
                  used to incrementally select inliers from a set of initial
                  correspondences, instead of using robust statistics that has
                  to handle all inliers and outliers together. These constraints
                  are so strong that the set of initial correspondences can
                  contain several times more outliers than inliers. Experiments
                  on a worst-case stereo sequence show that the method is
                  robust, accurate and can be used in real-time.},

                  desirable capability of a computer vision system. Range
                  images, which directly measure 3-D surface coordinates of a
                  scene, are well suited for this task. In this paper we report
                  a procedure to detect connected planar, convex, and concave
                  surfaces of 3-D objects. This is accomplished in three stages.
                  The first stage segments the range image into ``surface
                  patches'' by a square error criterion clustering algorithm
                  using surface points and associated surface normals. The
                  second stage classifies these patches as planar, convex, or
                  concave based on a non-parametric statistical test for trend,
                  curvature values, and eigenvalue analysis. In the final stage,
                  boundaries between adjacent surface patches are classified as
                  crease or noncrease edges, and this information is used to
                  merge compatible patches to produce reasonable faces of the
                  object(s). This procedure has been successfully applied to a
                  large number of real and synthetic images, four of which we
                  present in this paper.},

                  pairs of measurements of the coordinates of a number of points
                  in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds
                  applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I
                  present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares
                  problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical,
                  graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use.
                  Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit
                  quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry
                  property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The
                  best translational offset is the difference between the
                  centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and
                  scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The
                  best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square
                  deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their
                  respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred
                  to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected
                  points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is
                  the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue
                  of a symmetric 4 {\texttimes} 4 matrix. The elements of this
                  matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding
                  coordinates of the points.},

                  to cope with local illumination changes, such as shadows and
                  highlights, as well as global illumination changes. The
                  algorithm is based on a proposed computational color model
                  which separates the brightness from the chromaticity
                  component. We have applied this method to real image sequences
                  of both indoor and outdoor scenes. The results, which
                  demonstrate the system's performance, and some speed up
                  techniques we employed in our implementation are also shown.},

                  is extraordinarily fast and reliable. However, com- putational

                  challenge. This paper presents a simple method for the visual
                  saliency detection. Our model is independent of features,
                  categories, or other forms of prior knowledge of the objects.
                  By analyz- ing the log-spectrum of an input image, we extract
                  the spec- tral residual of an image in spectral domain, and
                  propose a fast method to construct the corresponding saliency
                  map in spatial domain. We test this model on both natural
                  pictures and artificial images such as psychological patterns.

                  to be quite distinct: localizing a robot in an unknown
                  environment and calibrating an embedded sensor network. We
                  show that both of these can be formulated as special cases of
                  a generalized localization problem. In the standard
                  localization problem, the aim is to determine the pose of some
                  object (usually a mobile robot) relative to a global
                  coordinate system. In our generalized version, the aim is to
                  determine the pose of all elements in a network (both fixed
                  and mobile) relative to an arbitrary global coordinate system.
                  We have developed a physically inspired "meshbased" formalism
                  for solving such problems. This paper outlines the formalism,
                  and describes its application to the concrete tasks of
                  multi-robot mapping and calibration of a distributed sensor
                  network. The paper presents experimental results for both
                  tasks obtained using a set of Pioneer mobile robots equipped
                  with scanning laser range-finders.},

                  core challenge for this program is to develop a system capable
                  of carrying out 'locate-and-protect' missions: the system must
                  be able to deploy a large number of robots into an unexplored
                  building, map the building interior, locate a valued object,
                  detect and track intruders, and transmit all of the above
                  information to a remote observer/operator. To satisfy these
                  requirements, we have developed a large heterogeneous robot
                  team consisting of approximately 80 robots. This paper
                  sketches the key technical elements of this system, and

                  applied to the problem of multirobot simultaneous localization
                  and mapping. We are inspired by the notion of a manifold,
                  which takes maps out of the two-dimensional plane and onto a
                  surface embedded in a higher-dimensional space. The key
                  advantage of the manifold representation is selfconsistency:
                  when closing loops, manifold maps do not suffer from the
                  "cross over" problem exhibited in planar maps. This
                  self-consistency, in turn, facilitates a number of important
                  capabilities, including autonomous exploration, search, and
                  retro-traverse. It also supports a very robust form of loop
                  closure, in which pairs of robots act collectively to confirm
                  or reject possible correspondence points. In this paper, we
                  develop the basic formalism of the manifold representation,

                  sub-matrix recovery algorithm for a recently developed submap
                  based exactly sparse Extended Information Filter (EIF) SLAM
                  algorithm -- Sparse Local Submap Joining Filter (SLSJF). The
                  algorithm achieves exact recovery instead of approximate
                  recovery. The recovery algorithm is very efficient because of
                  an incremental Cholesky factorization approach and a natural
                  reordering of the global state vector. Simulation results show
                  that the computation cost of the SLSJF is much lower as
                  compared with the sequential map joining algorithm using
                  Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The SLSJF with the proposed
                  recovery algorithm is also successfully applied to the
                  Victoria Park data set.},

  abstract =     {To interact effectively with humans, mobile robots will need
                  certain skills. One particularly important skill is the
                  ability to pursue moving agents. To do this, the robot needs a
                  robust visual tracking algorithm and an effective obstacle
                  avoidance algorithm, plus a means of integrating these two
                  behaviors in a seamless manner. In this paper, we introduce
                  the proximity space method as a means for performing
                  real-time, behavior-based control of visual gaze. We then show
                  how this method is integrated with robot motion using an
                  intelligent control architecture that can automatically
                  reconfigure the robot's behaviors in response to environmental

                  environments, use topological structures (graphs) as a spatial
                  representation. Localization can be done by deriving an
                  estimate of the global pose from landmark information. In this
                  case navigation is tightly coupled to metric knowledge, and
                  hence the derived control method is mainly pose-based.
                  Alternative to continuous metric localization, it is also
                  possible to base localization methods on weaker constraints,
                  e.g. the similarity between images capturing the appearance of
                  places or landmarks. In this case navigation can be controlled
                  by a homing algorithm. Similarity based localization can be
                  scaled to continuous metric localization by adding additional
                  constraints, such as alignment of depth estimates. We present
                  a method to scale a similarity based navigation system (the
                  view-graph-model) to continuous metric localization. Instead
                  of changing the landmark model, we embed the graph into the
                  three dimensional pose space. Therefore, recalibration of the
                  path integrator is only possible at discrete locations in the
                  environment. The navigation behavior of the robot is
                  controlled by a homing algorithm which combines three local
                  navigation capabilities, obstacle avoidance, path integration,
                  and scene based homing. This homing scheme allows automated
                  adaptation to the environment. It is further used to
                  compensate for path integration errors, and therefore allows
                  to derive globally consistent pose estimates based on
                  ?eak?metric knowledge, i.e. knowledge solely derived from
                  odometry. The system performance is tested with a robotic
                  setup and with a simulated agent which explores a large, open,
                  and cluttered environment.},

                  critical need for their use in military or civilian
                  applications. In general, self-calibration involves the
                  combination of absolute location information (e.g. GPS) with
                  relative calibration information (e.g. time delay or received
                  signal strength between sensors) over regions of the network.
                  Furthermore, it is generally desirable to distribute the
                  computational burden across the network and minimize the
                  amount of inter-sensor communication. We demonstrate that the
                  information used for sensor calibration is fundamentally local
                  with regard to the network topology and use this observation
                  to reformulate the problem within a graphical model framework.
                  We then demonstrate the utility of nonparametric belief
                  propagation (NBP), a recent generalization of particle
                  filtering, for both estimating sensor locations and
                  representing location uncertainties. NBP has the advantage
                  that it is easily implemented in a distributed fashion, admits
                  a wide variety of statistical models, and can represent
                  multi-modal uncertainty. We illustrate the performance of NBP
                  on several example networks while comparing to a previously
                  published nonlinear least squares method.},

                  small and cheap nodes capable of sensing, communication and

                  distributed sensing of environmental phenomena. In this paper,
                  we explore the directed diffusion paradigm for such
                  coordination. Directed diffusion is datacentric in that all
                  communication is for named data. All nodes in a directed
                  diffusion-based network are application-aware. This enables
                  diffusion to achieve energy savings by selecting empirically
                  good paths and by caching and processing data in-network. We
                  explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion for a
                  simple remote-surveillance sensor network.},

                  algorithm \cite{isard:98:a}. The paper proposes a combination
                  of Condensation with \emph{importance sampling} for increasing
                  the efficiency of probabilistic tracking. In contrast to
                  standard sequential Monte Carlo methods, importance sampling
                  chooses the samples in the resampling step not with respect to
                  their likelihoods but to a so-called importance function. The
                  application in the paper is hand tracking thus skin color is
                  the natural choice as this "guiding" cue for importance
                  sampling. This well-written paper provides an almost natural
                  extension to the original probabilistic tracking algorithm
                  introduced by the same authorship.},

                  for sensor-actuator networks that perform engineering tasks.
                  We provide a new foundation for data fusion based on two
                  concepts: a conceptual framework and the goal-seeking
                  paradigm. The conceptual framework emphasizes the dominant
                  structures in the system. The goal-seeking paradigm is a
                  mechanism for representing system evolution that explicitly
                  manages uncertainty. The goal-seeking formulation for data
                  fusion helps to distinguish between subjective decisions that
                  can be executed by computers. These notions are useful for
                  critical tasks, such as security management in large-scale
                  distributed systems. Investigations in this area, and further
                  refinement of the goal-seeking formulation for instrumentation
                  and measurement applications, are likely to future systems
                  that facilitate holistic user decision making.},

                  cues to robustly detect objects in adverse conditions. The
                  algorithm consists of three distinct levels i.e pixel level,
                  region level and frame level. At the pixel level, statistical
                  models of gradients and color are separately used to classify
                  each pixel as belonging to background or foreground. In region
                  level, foreground pixels obtained from the color based
                  subtraction are grouped into regions and gradient based sub-
                  traction is then used to make inferences about the validity of
                  these regions. Pixel based models are updated based on
                  decisions made at the region level. Finally frame level

                  of an object and its pose from a single image acquired with a
                  camera of unknown focal length. It is assumed that the object
                  in question can be modeled as a polyhedron where the
                  coordinates of the vertices can be expressed as a linear
                  function of a dimension vector. The reconstruction program
                  takes as input, a set of correspondences between features in
                  the model and features in the image. From this information,
                  the program determines an appropriate projection model for the
                  camera, the dimensions of the object, its pose relative to the
                  camera and, in the case of perspective projection, the focal
                  length of the camera. This paper describes how the
                  reconstruction problem can be framed as an optimization over a
                  compact set with low dimension (no more than four). This
                  optimization problem can be solved efficiently by coupling
                  standard nonlinear optimization techniques with a multistart
                  method. The result is an efficient, reliable solution system
                  that does not require initial estimates for any of the
                  parameters being estimated},

                  is based on an algorithm presented by Chiuso et al. (2000),

                  Soatto (2000). In particular, the algorithm is provably

                  suitable conditions. The core of the system, consisting of C++

                  code for development, is available at

                  3-D model of an object or of a multi-roomed indoor scene. In
                  this work, we address the problem of merging multiple textured
                  3-D data sets, each of which corresponds to a different view
                  of a scene or object. There are two steps to the merging
                  process: registration and integration. To register, or align,
                  data sets we use a modified version of the Iterative Closest
                  Point algorithm; our version, which we call color ICP,
                  considers not only 3-D information, but color as well. We show
                  that the use of color decreases registration error by an order
                  of magnitude. Once the 3-D data sets have been registered we
                  integrate them to produce a seamless, composite 3-D textured
                  model. Our approach to integration uses a 3-D occupancy grid
                  to represent likelihood of spatial occupancy through voting.
                  In addition to occupancy information, we store surface normal
                  in each voxel of the occupancy grid. Surface normal is used to
                  robustly extract a surface from the occupancy grid; on that
                  surface we blend textures from multiple views},

                  multiple classes of Gaussian mean images where only one class
                  is allowed per step. Then, there are hidden variables in the

                  pixelwisely modeled. Multiple layers/bg modeling were not
                  addressed in Jojic00cvpr. The model is layered model in that
                  it assumes that the image is generated by overlapping the bg
                  image with the fg'son top of one another with appropriate
                  translations. The possible tranlations (motions) are
                  predefined as discrete variables as in their Jojic00cvpr work.
                  The authors then solve the learning problem which involves the
                  learning of fgs/bg model+masks and motions in each image
                  through variational-EM in the maximum likelihood
                  frameowrkbecause the problem got coupled severely between
                  variables and exact EM is not feasible anymore. Unlike their
                  HMM work in Jojic00cvpr, they do not have put frame ordering
                  constraints in their model and allow all the translations to
                  be equally likely. This would suggest that a clever way of
                  using such dynamic constraints which is partly studied in
                  Jojic00cvpr by using HMMs as a way to have motion model can
                  improve the learning results. It is my impression that this is
                  very hard to solve the problems with dynamic constraints in
                  case of multiple layers. That would be the reason why Jojic
                  and Frey are using a static model that does not consider the
                  video ordering for this work. They successfully learn the
                  fgs/bg model from the unordered images, and show fg
                  subtraction, removal of a second fg selectively from the
                  video, person appearance enhancements. One main advantage of
                  their works would be the use of mask which seems to be rather
                  unintuitive, but can capture the non-rigid appearance of
                  arbitrary objects},

                  and inertial measurements. We analyze the model and
                  characterize the conditions under which its state is
                  observable, and its parameters are identifiable. These include
                  the unknown gravity vector, and the unknown transformation
                  between the camera coordinate frame and the inertial unit. We
                  show that it is possible to estimate both state and parameters
                  as part of an on-line procedure, but only provided that the
                  motion sequence is `rich enough', a condition that we
                  characterize explicitly. We then describe an efficient
                  implementation of a filter to estimate the state and
                  parameters of this model, including gravity and
                  camera-to-inertial calibration. It runs in real-time on an
                  embedded platform. We report experiments of continuous
                  operation, without failures, re-initialization, or
                  re-calibration, on paths of length up to 30 km. We also
                  describe an integrated approach to loop-closure', that is the
                  recognition of previously seen locations and the topological
                  re-adjustment of the traveled path. It represents visual
                  features relative to the global orientation reference provided
                  by the gravity vector estimated by the filter, and relative to
                  the scale provided by their known position within the map;
                  these features are organized into `locations' defined by
                  visibility constraints, represented in a topological graph,
                  where loop-closure can be performed without the need to
                  re-compute past trajectories or perform bundle adjustment. The
                  software infrastructure as well as the embedded platform is

                  that is determined in the E-step, based on the current
                  estimate of the motion. This virtual structure is then used in
                  the M-step to obtain a better estimate for the motion. We

                  provides an algorithmic foundation enabling a better
                  understanding of existing graphical model inference algorithms
                  and their connection to sparse matrix factorization methods.
                  Similar to a clique tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored
                  probability density, but unlike the clique tree it is directed
                  and maps more naturally to the square root information matrix
                  of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem.
                  In this paper, we highlight three insights provided by our new
                  data structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better
                  understanding of the matrix factorization in terms of
                  probability densities. Second, we show how the fairly abstract
                  updates to a matrix factorization translate to a simple
                  editing of the Bayes tree and its conditional densities.
                  Third, we apply the Bayes tree to obtain a completely novel
                  algorithm for sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, named
                  iSAM2, which achieves improvements in efficiency through
                  incremental variable re-ordering and fluid relinearization,
                  eliminating the need for periodic batch steps. We analyze

  r-kang06ftcgv ={For the unstructured Lumigraph work, Buehler et al. [8] apply
                  a more principled way of blending textures based on relative
                  angular position, resolution, and field-of-view. Kang and
                  Szeliski [47] use not just view-dependent textures, but
                  view-dependent geometries as well. This is to account for the
                  fact that stereo is only locally valid for scenes with
                  non-Lambertian properties. They blend warped depth images
                  (depth maps and textures) to produce new views, as shown in

                  algorithm, has been discovered and rediscovered in different

                  concepts and properties of cluster-tree decomposition
                  techniques by way of a single, unified framework for the

                  these areas. Specifically, we demonstrate that join-tree

                  elimination algorithms can be viewed as processing specific
                  cluster-tree decompositions. ... Our work expands on
                  \cite{Shafer90uai} in several ways. First, we use a
                  graph-based language, connecting our approach explicitly to
                  graphical models and using graph-based parameters for
                  capturing algorithmic principles. In particular, we provide
                  graph-based complexity analysis that focuses on the time vs.
                  space issue. Second, we emphasize the distinction between the
                  generation of a structural tree-decomposition and the
                  tree-processing algorithms that are enabled by the
                  decomposition. Third, we show that variable elimination
                  algorithms can be viewed as a specific tree-processing schemes
                  that can be generalized to full processing along special
                  tree-decompositions called bucket trees. Finally, we note how
                  different tree-decompositions of a given problem yield a
                  spectrum of time-space complexity characteristics using
                  superbuckets. ... Join-trees correspond to minimal
                  tree-decompositions. This restriction exclude the super-bucket
                  methods that accommodates time-space trade-offs. ... We
                  present these classes of algorithms by harnessing the formal
                  notation appearing in \cite{Gottlob00ai} (which is restricted
                  there to constraint satisfaction). This allows separating
                  tree-structuring from tree-processing.}

                  persist only when the environmental structure does not provide

                  as the rectangular walls of a room (Hintzman, O�Dell, & Arndt,
                  1981; Shelton & McNamara, 2001), the rectilinear grid of city

                  egocentric experience" "experienced views aligned with salient
                  environmental features are more likely to be used as reference
                  frames in memory than views misaligned with the environment"

                  showing that even nonexperienced orientations can be
                  represented under the appropriate conditions (Mou and
                  McNamara, 2002)" "Taken together, these results show that
                  egocentric experience, environmental structure, and task
                  demands can all combine to create reference frames used to
                  store spatial memories."},

                  that the target variable (hypotheses) are logically distant
                  from the observable events (data). In this situation it may be
                  difficult or impossible to assess the probabilistic connection
                  between them, but it may be possible to decompose the problem
                  through the use of intermediate or explanatory variables. That
                  is, it will often be possible to assess the likelihood of the
                  observed data given some intermediate variable, and the
                  likelihood of that intermediate variable given another, and so
                  on, until the hypotheses of interest are reached. Inferences
                  which incorporate one or more intermediate variables are
                  called hierarchical, cascaded, or multistage inferences. The
                  present paper presents a normative model for the solution of
                  the general hierarchical inference problem. The formulation
                  begins with a formal description of the hierarchical inference
                  tree, including a discussion of various simplifying
                  conditional independence assumptions. The solution is first
                  derived for three special case models of differing structure,
                  and then the algorithm for the general solution is given for
                  two cases: one in which the conditional independence
                  assumptions have been made and one in which they have not.},

  abstract =     {We present a real-time algorithm for foreground-background
                  segmentation. Sample background values at each pixel are
                  quantized into codebooks which represent a compressed form of
                  background model for a long image sequence. This allows us to
                  capture structural background variation due to periodic-like
                  motion over a long period of time under limited memory. The
                  codebook representation is efficient in memory and speed
                  compared with other background modeling techniques. Our method
                  can handle scenes containing moving backgrounds or
                  illumination variations, and it achieves robust detection for
                  different types of videos. We compared our method with other
                  multimode modeling techniques. In addition to the basic
                  algorithm, two features improving the algorithm are
                  presented-layered modeling/detection and adaptive codebook

                  reconstruct 3D scene geometry if visible texture is sparse or

                  (ToF) depth sensors can provide 3D information regardless of
                  texture but with only limited resolution and accuracy. To find
                  an optimal reconstruction, we propose an integrated multi-view
                  sensor fusion approach that combines information from multiple
                  color cameras and multiple ToF depth sensors. First,
                  multi-view ToF sensor measurements are combined to obtain a
                  coarse but complete model. Then, the initial model is refined
                  by means of a probabilistic multi-view fusion framework,
                  optimizing over an energy function that aggregates ToF depth
                  sensor information with multi-view stereo and silhouette
                  constraints. We obtain high quality dense and detailed 3D
                  models of scenes challenging for stereo alone, while
                  simultaneously reducing complex noise of ToF sensors.},

                  flow. Because animals with frontal eyes can sample only a
                  portion of the flow field, they must continuously scan in
                  order to be aware of their surroundings. Such scanning
                  introduces additional transformations of the retinal image,
                  apparently complicating the extraction from retinal flow of
                  the information in optical flow. In this study, the authors
                  conducted computer simulations of eye movement graphically.
                  These simulations revealed that when gaze direction coincides
                  with heading direction on curvilinear paths, velocity vectors
                  in the image plane become linearized. The active rotation of
                  the eyes is, in effect, an essential mechanism for extracting
                  the self-movement information contained in optical flow from
                  flow patterns on the retinas. Strategically positioning the
                  eyes renders a nonlinear flow linear and, thereby, converts a
                  complicated information pickup problem into a considerably
                  simpler problem. Based on these simulations, the authors
                  contend that heading direction is specified by the
                  perpendicularly aligned vectors.},

  quotes =       {A possible resolution is suggested, however, by a simulation
                  of the retinal flow when the eyes are directed at a point
                  lying on the locomotory path. For this field of view, all the
                  image trajectories are linearized. The vector directions in
                  Figure 3e are the same over successive frames. Each velocity
                  vector [] lies in the direction tangent to the corresponding
                  flow line (i.e., the trajectory that a surface element
                  traces). Curves formed by connecting the velocity vectors with
                  the same direction define streamlines of a flow field (Sutton,
                  1957). .. In contrast to the complexities suggested by the
                  preceding remarks, there seems to be a simple rule for
                  identifying the path of locomotion regardless of its nature,
                  that is, linear or circular: Move the eyes until the image
                  trajectories on the retina are rendered linear; then you are
                  looking in the direction in which you are heading, and the
                  trajectory defined by the perpendicular image vectors is your
                  path of locomotion. .. To conclude, why do we rotate the eyes
                  if, as often argued, rotation serves only to induce ambiguity?
                  Based on the arguments presented here, the active rotation of
                  the eyes is, in effect, an essential mechanism for extracting
                  the self-movement information contained in optical flow from

  abstract =     {The ability to localise a camera moving in a previously
                  unknown environment is desirable for a wide range of
                  applications. In computer vision this problem is studied as
                  monocular SLAM. Recent years have seen improvements to the
                  usability and scalability of monocular SLAMsystems to the
                  point that they may soon find uses outside of laboratory
                  conditions. However, the robustness of these systems to rapid
                  camera motions (we refer to this quality as agility) still
                  lags behind that of tracking systems which use known object
                  models. In this paper we attempt to remedy this. We present
                  two approaches to improving the agility of a keyframe-based
                  SLAM system: Firstly, we add edge features to the map and
                  exploit their resilience to motion blur to improve tracking
                  under fast motion. Secondly, we implement a very simple
                  inter-frame rotation estimator to aid tracking when the camera
                  is rapidly panning � and demonstrate that this method also
                  enables a trivially simple yet effective relocalisation
                  method. Results show that a SLAM system combining points, edge
                  features and motion initialisation allows highly agile
                  tracking at a moderate increase in processing time.},

  year =         1984,

  abstract =     {This study addresses the question of how simple networks can
                  account for a variety of phenomena associated with the shift
                  of a specialized processing focus across the visual scene. We
                  address in particular aspects of the dichotomy between the
                  preattentive-parallel and the attentive-serial modes of visual
                  perception and their hypothetical neuronal implementations.
                  Specifically, we propose the following: (1) A number of
                  elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of
                  movement, disparity etc. are represented in parallel in
                  different topographical maps, called the early representation.
                  (2) There exists a selective mapping from this early
                  representation into a more central representation, such that
                  at any instant the central representation contains the
                  properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the
                  {\it selected} location. (3) We discuss some selection rules
                  that determine which location will be mapped into the central
                  representation. The major rule, using the saliency or
                  conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is
                  implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network. A
                  hierarchical pyramid--like architecture is proposed for this
                  network. We suggest possible implementations in neuronal
                  hardware, including a possible role for the extensive
                  back-projection form the cortex to the LGN.},

  abstract =     {Automatic symbolic traffic scene analysis is essen- tial to
                  many areas of IVHS (Intelligent Vehicle High- way Systems).
                  Traffic scene information can be used to optimize traffic flow
                  during busy periods, identify stalled vehicles and accidents,
                  and aid the decision- making of an autonomous vehicle
                  controller. Improve- ments in technologies for machine
                  vision-based surveil- lance and high-level symbolic reasoning
                  have enabled us to develop a system for detailed, reliable
                  traffic scene analysis. The machine vision component of our
                  system employs a contour tracker and an affine motion model
                  based on Kalman filters to extract vehicle trajectories over a
                  sequence of traffic scene images. The symbolic reasoning
                  component uses a dynamic belief network to make inferences
                  about traffic events such as vehicle lane changes and stalls.
                  In this paper, we discuss the key tasks of the vision and
                  reasoning components as well as their integration into a
                  working prototype. Prelim- inary results of an implementation
                  on special purpose hardware using C-40 Digital Signal
                  Processors show that near real-time performance can be
                  achieved with- out further improvements.},

                  sharp cutoff, so that only inference in polytrees was
                  tractable. ... Thus, if we find a chordal graph that contains
                  the moralized graph , we can use it as the basis for inference
                  on . The process of turning a graph into a chordal graph is
                  also called triangulation. ... Historically, largely due to
                  the initial popularity of the polytree algorithm, the
                  conditioning approach has been mostly used in the case where
                  the transformed network is a polytree. ... one might wonder
                  why anyone bothers with the con- ditioning algorithm. There
                  are two main reasons. First, variable elimination gains its
                  computational savings from caching factors computed as
                  intermediate results. The second reason for using conditioning
                  is that it forms the basis for a useful approximate inference
                  algorithm.}

                  features. The relationship between frames is kept as a
                  nonlinear measurement, and can be used to solve large loop
                  closures quickly. Both monocular (bearing-only) and binocular
                  vision can be used to generate matches. Other advantages of
                  our system are that no special landmark initialization is
                  required, and large loops can be solved very quickly.},

                  integrated system to localize a mobile robot in rough outdoor

                  strategies, incremental bundle adjustment, and filtering with

                  efficiently exploited for image based rendering as well as
                  robotic navigation and localization tasks. In this paper we
                  present an approach for automatic extraction of dominant
                  rectangular structures from a single view and show how they
                  facilitate the recovery of camera pose, planar structure and
                  matching across widely separated views. In the presented
                  approach the rectangular hypothesis formation is based on a
                  higher level information encoded by the presence of orthogonal
                  vanishing directions, the dominant rectangular structures can
                  be detected and matched despite the presence of multiple
                  repetitive structures often encountered in a variety of
                  buildings. Different stages of the approach are demonstrated
                  on various examples of images of indoors and outdoors

  abstract =     {The computational complexity of SLAM is dominated by the cost
                  of factorizing a matrix derived from the measurements into a
                  square root form, which has cubic complexity in the worst
                  case. However, the matrices associated with the full SLAM
                  problem are typically very sparse, as opposed to the dense
                  problems one obtains in a filtering context. Hence much
                  faster, sparse factorization algorithms can be used.
                  Furthermore, the cost can be further reduced by choosing a
                  good order in which to eliminate variables during the
                  factorization process, leading to more or less fill-in. In
                  particular, in this paper we investigate how a nested
                  dissection ordering method can provably improve the
                  performance of the full SLAM algorithm. We show that the
                  computational complexity for the factorization of a large
                  class of measurement matrices occurring in the SLAM problem
                  can be tightly bound under reasonable assumptions.},
  c-kaess =      {This paper analyzes the complexity of planar SLAM based on
                  nested dissection. A quick comparison for planar SLAM examples
                  shows only a marginal advantage of AMD ordering over nested
                  dissection, but the latter is easier to analyze. Based on
                  existing theorems, it is shown that planar SLAM with nested
                  dissection has fill-in O(n log n) and time complexity
                  O(n^1.5), but with potentially large constant factors. While
                  SLAM graphs even in planar environments are not exactly
                  planar, they can be "compressed" (graph theory) into a meta
                  graph that is exactly planar. An urban map serves as example.
                  Special cases with linear complexity are environments of
                  bounded size (first eliminate all poses - Schur complement
                  trick), exploration without loop closure, and fixed sensor
                  networks (first eliminate all structure).},

                  many variables often exploit the manner in which the given
                  functions factor as a product of `local' functions, each of
                  which depends on a subset of the variables. Such a
                  factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we
                  call a factor graph. In this tutorial paper, we present a
                  generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm,
                  that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple
                  computational rule, the sum-product algorithm
                  computes---either exactly or approximately---various marginal
                  functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of
                  algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal
                  processing, and digital communications can be derived as
                  specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the
                  forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the
                  iterative `turbo' decoding algorithm, Pearl's belief

                  including various types of simultaneous localization and
                  mapping (SLAM) or bundle adjustment (BA) can be phrased as
                  least squares optimization of an error function that can be
                  represented by a graph. This paper describes the general
                  structure of such problems and presents g2o, an open-source
                  C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error
                  functions. Our system has been designed to be easily
                  extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem
                  typically can be specified in a few lines of code. The current
                  implementation provides solutions to several variants of SLAM
                  and BA. We provide evaluations on a wide range of real-world
                  and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that while
                  being general g2o offers a performance comparable to

  abstract =     {The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy is a model of knowledge of
                  large-scale space consisting of multiple interacting
                  representations, both qualitative and quantitative. The SSH is
                  inspired by the properties of the human cognitive map, and is
                  intended to serve both as a model of the human cognitive map
                  and as a method for robot exploration and map-building. The
                  multiple levels of the SSH express states of partial
                  knowledge, and thus enable the human or robotic agent to deal
                  robustly with uncertainty during both learning and
                  problem-solving. The control level represents useful patterns
                  of sensorimotor interaction with the world in the form of
                  trajectory-following and hill-climbing control laws leading to
                  locally distinctive states. Local geometric maps in local
                  frames of reference can be constructed at the control level to
                  serve as observers for control laws in particular
                  neighborhoods. The causal level abstracts continuous behavior
                  among distinctive states into a discrete model consisting of
                  states linked by actions. The topological level introduces the
                  external ontology of places, paths and regions by abduction,
                  to explain the observed pattern of states and actions at the
                  causal level. Quantitative knowledge at the control, causal
                  and topological levels supports a ?atchworkmap?of local
                  geometric frames of reference linked by causal and topological
                  connections. The patchwork map can be merged into a single
                  global frame of reference at the metrical level when
                  sufficient information and computational resources are
                  available. We describe the assumptions and guarantees behind
                  the generality of the SSH across environments and sensorimotor
                  systems. Evidence is presented from several partial
                  implementations of the SSH on simulated and physical robots.},

                  extension to the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy that combines
                  their strengths and avoids their weaknesses. Metrical SLAM
                  methods are used to build local maps of small-scale space
                  within the sensory horizon of the agent, while topological
                  methods are used to represent the structure of large-scale
                  space. We describe how a local perceptual map is analyzed to
                  identify a local topology description and is abstracted to a
                  topological place. The mapbuilding method creates a set of
                  topological map hypotheses that are consistent with travel
                  experience. The set of maps is guaranteed under reasonable
                  assumptions to include the correct map. We demonstrate the

                  aid online mapbuilding. First, local metrical motion planning
                  and obstacle avoidance can take place within the LPM. Second,

                  place neighborhood, rather than requiring physical
                  hill-climbing to a distinctive pose. If resources needed for
                  metrical localization become unavailable, navigation can fall
                  back on hill-climbing as in the basic SSH. Third, structural
                  ambiguity due to large loops or false positive place matches

  r-kuipers08chapter ={Having defined large-scale space as space whose structure
                  is larger than the sensory horizon, it is natural to define
                  small-scale space as space whose structure is within the
                  sensory horizon. Small-scale space is described by a local
                  perceptual map that is metrically accurate and is constructed
                  directly from sensory input. Recently developed SLAM methods
                  are well suited for creating such a local perceptualmap.We
                  avoid the problem of closing large loops by confining the map
                  to the agent? local perceptual surround, where we can apply
                  the strengths of existing SLAM methods. When reasoning about
                  small-scale space, we are concerned only with the frame of
                  reference of the local perceptual map, and not with its
                  inevitable drift with respect to the world frame of reference.
                  We call the resulting combined model of large-scale and
                  small-scale space, the hybrid SSH.}

  abstract =     {This dissertation presents a model of the knowledge a person
                  has about the spatial structure of a large-scale environment:
                  the ``cognitive map.'' The functions of the cognitive map are
                  to assimilate new information about the environment, to
                  represent the current position, and to answer route-finding
                  and relative-position problems. This model (called the TOUR
                  model) analyzes the cognitive map in terms of symbolic
                  descriptions of the environment and operations on those
                  descriptions. Knowledge about a particular environment is
                  represented in terms of route descriptions, a topological
                  network of paths and places, multiple frames of reference for
                  relative positions, dividing boundaries, and a structure of
                  containing regions. The current position is described by the
                  ``You Are Here'' pointer, which acts as a working memory and a
                  focus of attention. Operations on the cognitive map are
                  performed by inference rules which act to transfer information
                  among different descriptions and the ``You Are Here'' pointer.
                  The TOUR model shows how the particular descriptions chosen to
                  represent spatial knowledge support assimilation of new
                  information from local observations into the cognitive map,
                  and how the cognitive map solves route-finding and
                  relative-position problems. A central theme of this research
                  is that the states of partial knowledge supported by a
                  representation are responsible for its ability to function
                  with limited information or computational resources. The
                  representations in the TOUR model provide a rich collection of
                  states of partial knowledge, and therefore exhibit flexible,
                  ``common-sense'' behavior.},

  abstract =     {The "Map in the Head" metaphor states that knowledge of
                  large-scale space is isomorphic to the information stored in a
                  graphical map: That is, corresponding operations are used to
                  store and retrieve information. The purpose of this essay is
                  to look carefully at the "Map in the Head" metaphor to see the
                  limits of its applicability. There are two types of
                  experimental results that are difficult to accommodate within
                  this metaphor. First, instead of being integrated into a
                  single map, spatial knowledge can fall into disconnected
                  components, with little or no relation between the components.
                  Second, knowledge of routes (and other spatial facts) may be
                  represented asymmetrically, so that a route can be followed in
                  one direction but not in the other. The first set of results
                  leads us to replace the simple "Map in the Head" with a more
                  complex and sophisticated metaphor including separate metrical
                  and topological components. The second set of results suggests
                  that even the more sophisticated "Map in the Head" is built
                  from computational structures that occasionally reveal their
                  nonmaplike properties. A computational model is presented for
                  assimilating observations gathered during travel, first into a
                  description of the particular route, then into representations
                  for the topological and metrical features of the environment.},

  abstract =     {A number of positioning identification techniques have been
                  used for mobile robots. Dead reckoning is a popular method,
                  but is not reliable when a robot travels long distances or
                  over an uneven surface because of variations in wheel diameter
                  and wheel slippage. The landmark method, which estimates the
                  current position relative to landmarks, cannot be used in an
                  uncharted environment. The authors propose a new method called
                  ?�cooperative positioning with multiple robots?? For
                  cooperative positioning, the authors divide the robots into
                  two groups, A and B. One group, say A, remains stationary and
                  acts as a landmark while group B moves. The moving group B
                  then stops and acts as a landmark for group A. This
                  ?�dance??is repeated until the target robot position are
                  reached. Cooperative positioning has a far lower accumulated
                  positioning error than dead reckoning, and can work in
                  three-dimensions which is not possible with dead reckoning.
                  Also, this method has inherent landmarks and therefore works
                  in uncharted environments. This paper discusses the
                  positioning accuracy of the authors' method with error
                  variances for an example with three mobile robots},

                  this paper. Variations to standard PF are proposed to remedy
                  the sample impoverishment problem in bearing-only SLAM. A CCD
                  camera mounted on the robot is used as the measuring device
                  and image quality is incorporated into data association, PF

                  maintain the accuracy of the SLAM process is also illustrated.

                  the simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem with
                  a bearing-only sensor. The main contribution of the paper is
                  to provide a remedy for the landmark initialisation problem
                  that occurs due to the absence of range information, in a
                  computationally efficient manner. Each landmark is initialised
                  in the form of multiple hypotheses distributed along the
                  direction of the bearing measurement. Using subsequent
                  measurements, the validity of the hypotheses is evaluated
                  based on the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT).
                  Consequently, the best approximation to the landmark location
                  is maintained. This approach enables an extended Kalman filler
                  (EKF) to be used for bearing-only SLAM providing a
                  computational efficient solution. Simulation and experimental
                  results, from using a camera as the bearing-only sensor
                  mounted on a Pioneer robot are included to demonstrate the

                  hand movements in extended food preparation tasks, and here
                  the results are compared. The tasks could be divided into a
                  series of actions performed on objects. The eyes usually
                  reached the next object in the sequence before any sign of
                  manipulative action, indicating that eye movements are planned
                  into the motor pattern and lead each action. The eyes usually
                  fixated the same object throughout the action upon it,
                  although they often moved on to the next object in the
                  sequence before completion of the preceding action. The
                  specific roles of individual fixations could be identified as
                  locating (establishing the locations of objects for future
                  use), directing (establishing target direction prior to
                  contact), guiding (supervising the relative movements of two
                  or three objects) and checking (establishing whether some
                  particular condition is met, prior to the termination of an
                  action). It is argued that, at the beginning of each action,
                  the oculomotor system is supplied with the identity of the
                  required object, information about its location, and
                  instructions about the nature of the monitoring required
                  during the action. The eye movements during this kind of task
                  are nearly all to task-relevant objects, and thus their
                  control is seen as primarily ?op-down? and influenced very
                  little by the ?ntrinsic salience?of objects.},

                  available to take over. .. Object localization is often a
                  two-stage process, with place memory being used to get the
                  eyes close enough for direct object detection. In some cases,
                  where an object has not been located previously, a simple
                  scanning strategy was also invoked, but this was fairly
                  uncommon. .. Our studies lend no support to the idea that the

                  and operates from that. Most information is obtained from the

                  combination of fast saccadic eye movements and rather slower
                  head movements. Since the first study on freely moving
                  subjects, most authors have agreed that the head movement
                  component of gaze is very variable, with a high 'volitional'
                  component. But in some circumstances head and eye movements
                  can be quite predictable, for example when a subject is asked
                  to shift gaze as quickly as possible. Under these conditions,
                  laboratory studies have shown that the eye and head
                  motor-systems both receive gaze-change commands, although they
                  execute them in rather different ways. Here I reconsider the
                  way gaze direction is changed during free movement, but in the
                  performance of a task where the subject is too busy to exert
                  conscious control over head or eye movements. Using a new
                  portable and inexpensive method for recording head and eye
                  movements, I examine the oculomotor behaviour of car drivers,
                  particularly during the large gaze changes made at road
                  junctions. The results show that the pattern of eye and head

                  pattern of the road ahead. There are many theories about what
                  features a driver might use, and recent attempts to engineer
                  self-steering vehicles have sharpened interest in the
                  mechanisms involved. However, there is little direct
                  information linking steering performance to the driver's
                  direction of gaze. We have made simultaneous recordings of
                  steering-wheel angle and drivers' gaze direction during a
                  series of drives along a tortuous road. We found that drivers
                  rely particularly on the 'tangent point' on the inside of each
                  curve, seeking this point 1? s before each bend and returning
                  to it throughout the bend. The direction of this point
                  relative to the car's heading predicts the curvature of the
                  road ahead, and we examine the way this information is used.},

                  depicted in Figure 2c. The utility of this point appears to be
                  maximized at 1 sec into a bend (> 75\% of the time is spent at
                  fixating this point), after which it degrades rapidly (only
                  50\% after 2 sec). Donges (1978) suggesed that, for successful
                  steering, drivers need not only information about the
                  curvature of the desired path but information about the
                  vehicle's current position. In a laboratory study based on
                  Land and Lee, Land and Horwood (1995) observed that the
                  crucial portion of the road for successful steering is not the
                  distant part but a portion about 4 to 60 below the horizon of
                  the road. Note that the distant part is where the tangent
                  point is clearly visible, whereas the optimum portion lacks
                  such a point. The results are consistent with Gibson's (1966,
                  1979/1986) notion of visual kinethesis, the information about
                  the movement of the observer with respect to the environment,
                  provided in optical flow. That is, optical flow contains
                  information about the observer, which in tum is used to
                  correct his or her locomotion (i.e., not only the future path
                  but position in the road).},

                  movements. The majority show a pattern of stable fixations
                  with fast saccades that shift the direction of gaze. These
                  movements may be made by the eyes themselves, or the head, or
                  in some insects the whole body. The main reason for keeping
                  gaze still during fixations is the need to avoid the blur that
                  results from the long response time of the photoreceptors.
                  Blur begins to degrade the image at a retinal velocity of
                  about 1 receptor acceptance angle per response time. Some
                  insects (e.g. hoverflies) stabilise their gaze much more
                  rigidly than this rule implies, and it is suggested that the
                  need to see the motion of small objects against a background
                  imposes even more stringent conditions on image motion. A
                  third reason for preventing rotational image motion is to
                  prevent contamination of the translational flow-field, by
                  which a moving animal can judge its heading and the distances
                  of objects. Some animals do let their eyes rotate smoothly,
                  and these include some heteropod molluscs, mantis shrimps and
                  jumping spiders, all of which have narrow linear retinae which
                  scan across the surroundings. Hymenopteran insects also rotate
                  during orientation flights at speeds of 100?00?s. This is just
                  consistent with a blur-free image, as are the scanning speeds
                  of the animals with linear retinae.},

  abstract =     {This paper establishes a general framework for Bayesian
                  model-based clustering, in which subset labels are
                  exchangeable, and items are also exchangeable, possibly up to
                  covariate effects. It is rich enough to encompass a variety of
                  existing procedures, including some recently discussed
                  methodologies involving stochastic search or hierarchical
                  clustering, but more importantly allows the formulation of
                  clustering procedures that are optimal with respect to a
                  specified loss function. Our focus is on loss functions based
                  on pairwise coincidences, that is, whether pairs of items are
                  clustered into the same subset or not. Optimisation of the
                  posterior expected loss function can be formulated as a binary
                  integer programming problem, which can be readily solved, for
                  example by the simplex method, when clustering a modest number
                  of items, but quickly becomes impractical as problem scale
                  increases. To combat this, a new heuristic item-swapping
                  algorithm is introduced. This performs well in our numerical
                  experiments, on both simulated and real data examples. The
                  paper includes a comparison of the statistical performance of
                  the (approximate) optimal clustering with earlier methods that
                  are model-based but ad hoc in their detailed definition.},

                  nonstationary temporal distributions of pixels in video
                  surveillance applications. However, a common problem for this
                  approach is balancing between model convergence speed and
                  stability. This paper proposes an effective scheme to improve
                  the convergence rate without compromising model stability.
                  This is achieved by replacing the global, static retention
                  factor with an adaptive learning rate calculated for each
                  Gaussian at every frame. Significant improvements are shown on
                  both synthetic and real video data. Incorporating this
                  algorithm into a statistical framework for background
                  subtraction leads to an improved segmentation performance

                  bandwidth stream of correctly associated measurements to this
                  feature becomes available. .. We envision a robot that

                  dened by one of the features in the submap. The global

                  situations where the mobile robot is able to make repeated

                  convergence to a near-optimal result with O(1) time complexity

  abstract =     {This paper presents an algorithm for autonomous map building
                  and maintenance for a mobile robot. We believe that mobile
                  robot navigation can be treated as a problem of tracking
                  geometric features which occur naturally in the environment.
                  We represent each feature in the map by a location estimate
                  (the feature state vector) and two distinct measures of
                  uncertainty: a covariance matrix to represent uncertainty in
                  feature location, and a credibility measure to represent our
                  belief in the validity of the feature. During each position
                  update cycle, predicted measurements are generated for each
                  geometric feature in the map and compared to actual sensor
                  observations. Successful matches cause a feature's credibility
                  to be increased. Unpredicted observations are used to
                  initialize new geometric features, while unobserved
                  predictions result in a geometric feature's credibility being
                  decreased. We describe experimental results obtained with the
                  algorithm that demonstrate successful map building using real
                  sonar data.},

  quotes =       {We have developed a multi-level theory of spatial
                  representation of the environment based upon the observation
                  and re-acquisition of distinctive visual events, i.e.,
                  landmarks. The representation provides the theoretical
                  foundations for a visual memory database that includes
                  coordinate-free, topological representation of relative
                  spatial location, yet smoothly integrates available metric
                  knowledge of relative or absolute angles and distances. .. A
                  key contribution of this work is the realization of true local
                  coordinate systems, and a theory that makes them
                  computationally useful to a sighted mobile robot. Using
                  visually-based local coordinate systems, which we call
                  viewframes, a robot can navigate about its environment,
                  determining its relative location in the world with
                  essentially a constant error. In particular, there is no
                  multiplicative accumulation of error in location. ..
                  Furthermore, humans and animals perform navigation and
                  guidance tasks quite reliably with extremely poor range
                  estimates, and very coarse angular information. .. the notion
                  of a geographic "place" is defined in terms of data about
                  visible landmarks. A place, as a point on the surface of the
                  ground, is defined by the landmarks and spatial relationships
                  between landmarks that can be observed from a fixed location.
                  More generally we can define a place as a region in space, in
                  which a fixed set of landmarks can be observed from anywhere
                  in the region, and relationships between them do not change in
                  some appropriate qualitative sense. Data about places is
                  stored in structures called viewframes, boundaries and
                  orientation regions},

                  behavioral parameterization in the framework of a Case-Based
                  Reasoning methodology for autonomous navigation tasks. It is
                  based on our previous work on a behavior-based robotic system
                  that also employed spatio-temporal case-based reasoning in the
                  selection of behavioral parameters but was not capable of
                  learning new parameterizations. The present method extends the
                  case-based reasoning module by making it capable of learning
                  new and optimizing the existing cases where each case is a set
                  of behavioral parameters. The learning process can either be a
                  separate training process or be part of the mission execution.
                  In either case, the robot learns an optimal parameterization
                  of its behavior for different environments it encounters. The
                  goal of this research is not only to automatically optimize
                  the performance of the robot but also to avoid the manual
                  configuration of behavioral parameters and the initial
                  configuration of a case library, both of which require the
                  user to possess good knowledge of robot behavior and the
                  performance of numerous experiments. The presented method was
                  integrated within a hybrid robot architecture and evaluated in
                  extensive computer simulations, showing a significant increase
                  in the performance over a nonadaptive system and a performance
                  comparable to a non-learning CBR system that uses a hand-coded
                  case library.},

                  doors or walls. We show how to extend relational Markov
                  networks in order to reason about a hierarchy of objects and
                  the spatial relationships between them. Markov chain Monte
                  Carlo is used for ef cient inference and to learn the
                  parameters of the model. We show that the spatial constraints
                  modeled by our mapping technique yield drastic improvements
                  for labeling line segments extracted from laser rangefinders.},

                  in Bayesian belief networks that derives significant
                  advantages from focused inference and relevance reasoning.
                  This framework is based on d -separation and other simple and
                  computationally efficient techniques for pruning irrelevant
                  parts of a network. Our main contribution is a technique that
                  we call relevance-based decomposition. Relevance-based
                  decomposition approaches belief updating in large networks by
                  focusing on their parts and decomposing them into partially
                  overlapping subnetworks. This makes reasoning in some
                  intractable networks possible and, in addition, often results
                  in significant speedup, as the total time taken to update all
                  subnetworks is in practice often considerably less than the
                  time taken to update the network as a whole. We report results
                  of empirical tests that demonstrate practical significance of
                  our approach.},

                  \log n)$ and space $O(n^{3/2})$ time. We generalize this
                  method without degrading the time and space bounds so that it
                  applies to any system of equations defined on a planar or
                  almost-planar graph. Such systems arise in the solution of
                  two-dimensional finite element problems. Our method uses the
                  fact that planar graphs have good separators. More generally,
                  we show that sparse Gaussian elimination is efficient for any
                  class of graphs which have good separators, and conversely
                  that graphs without good separators (including "almost all"
                  sparse graphs) are not amenable to sparse Gaussian
                  elimination.},

                  and space while solving sparse systems of linear equations by
                  elimination; the approach is purely graph-theoretic. If the
                  system has many zero coefficients and they are appropriately
                  distributed, a convenient order of elimination might be found
                  such that not many new nonzero coefficients arise in
                  originally zero positions and so the number of necessary
                  multiplications is low. An important aspect is that the
                  numbering algorithm itself does not require many operations.
                  A. George \cite{George73siam} has found an effective numbering
                  for the system whose graph is a planar square grid. For such a
                  system of $n$ equations the number of multiplications is
                  $O(n^{3/2})$. A planar grid of $n$ nodes collapses when
                  $O(n^{1/2})$ nodes are removed. The authors show that this,
                  and not the sparsity itself, is the property that is
                  sufficient, and also necessary, for the existence of a
                  numbering that gives the $O(n^{3/2})$ multiplication count.
                  So, George's numbering may be applied to the equation system
                  arising from the finite elements method for the
                  two-dimensional problem, giving again $O(n^{3/2})$
                  multiplications. For a three-dimensional grid, the
                  multiplication count is $O(n^2)$. \{The remark after Theorem 6
                  should read $\sigma=(d-1)/d$\}. The theorems and some proofs
                  give estimates for the coefficients in the $O(·)$ positions.}

                  operations in sparse matrix computation is the minimum-degree
                  algorithm. The notion of multiple elimination is introduced
                  here as a modification to the conventional scheme. The
                  motivation is discussed using the $k\times k$ grid model
                  problem. Experimental results indicate that the modified
                  version retains the fill-reducing property of (and is often
                  better than) the original ordering algorithm and yet requires
                  less computer time. The reduction in ordering time is problem
                  dependent, and for some problems the modified algorithm can
                  run a few times faster than existing implementations of the
                  minimum-degree algorithm. The use of external degree in the
                  algorithm is also introduced.},

                  vision for 3D reconstruction. A method is proposed for
                  vertical line segment detection and subsequent local geometric
                  map building. Visual and inertial sensing are two sensory
                  modalities that can be explored to give robust solutions on
                  image segmentation and recovery of 3D structure from images,
                  increasing the capabilities of autonomous vehicles and
                  enlarging the application potential of vision systems. From
                  the inertial sensors, a camera stereo rig, and a few system
                  parameters we can recover the 3D parameters of the ground
                  plane and vertical lines. The homography between stereo images
                  of ground points can be found. By detecting the vertical line
                  segments in each image, and using the homography of ground
                  points for the foot of each segment, the lines can be matched
                  and reconstructed in 3D. The mobile robot then maps the
                  detected vertical line segments in a world map as it moves. To
                  build this map an outlier removal method is implemented and a
                  statistical approach used, so that a simplified metric map can
                  be obtained for robot navigation.},

  abstract =     {A robot exploring an unknown environment may need to build a
                  world model from sensor measurements. In order to integrate
                  all the frames of sensor data, it is essential to align the
                  data properly. An incremental approach has been typically used
                  in the past, in which each local frame of data is aligned to a
                  cumulative global model, and then merged to the model. Because
                  dierent parts of the model are updated independently while
                  there are errors in the registration, such an approach may
                  result in an inconsistent model. In this paper, we study the
                  problem of consistent registration of multiple frames of
                  measurements (range scans), together with the related issues
                  of representation and manipulation of spatial uncertainties.
                  Our approach is to maintain all the local frames of data as
                  well as the relative spatial relationships between local
                  frames. These spatial relationships are modeled as random
                  variables and are derived from matching pairwise scans or from
                  odometry. Then we formulate a procedure based on the maximum
                  likelihood criterion to optimally combine all the spatial
                  relations. Consistency is achieved by using all the spatial
                  relations as constraints to solve for the data frame poses
                  simultaneously. Experiments with both simulated and real data
                  will be presented.},

                  from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual sensors,
                  such that initial conditions of the inertial integration,
                  including gravity estimation, can be recovered quickly and in
                  a linear manner, thus removing any need for special
                  initialization procedures. The algorithm is implemented using
                  a graphical simultaneous localization and mapping like
                  approach that guarantees constant time output. This paper
                  discusses the technical aspects of the work, including
                  observability and the ability for the system to estimate scale
                  in real time. Results are presented of the system, estimating
                  the platforms position, velocity, and attitude, as well as
                  gravity vector and sensor alignment and calibration on-line in

  r-kuipers77thesis ={Kevin Lynch's delightful book [] was responsible for the
                  recent surge of interest in mental images of the environment.
                  One central point is that the mental image can be decomposed
                  into symbolic elements, and is not necessarily pictorial in
                  nature or properties. He distinguishes between the qualities
                  of imageability and legibility of an environment. Imageability
                  concerns the sensory aspects of the environment and how its
                  landmarks evoke strong reactions. Legibility concerns the
                  structural aspects of the environment and how a traveler can
                  find his way around in it. The properties that determine
                  legibility are the ones addressed by this research. .. Lynch
                  decomposed the knowledge in the cognitive map into five
                  elements: landmarks, nodes, paths, edges, and districts. Their
                  functions and relation- ships correspond roughly with those of
                  places, paths, and regions in the TOUR model.}

                  up with an invariant which would capture the assumptions about
                  the task success and monitor that ivariant. Lyons in sddition
                  to task two other processes that is the invariant monitoring
                  process and the goal monitoring process. The notion of
                  invariants was also used by Donald. Ecah control strategy has
                  it's own invariant. Lyons showed how the invariants can be
                  composed based on composition operators. Invariants handle
                  only error monitoring. The recovery is done by chaining the
                  recovery with the monitoring procedure}

                  architecture exploiting the structure of the original Bayesian
                  network and independence relations induced by evidence to
                  improve the efficiency of inference. The efficiency
                  improvements are obtained by maintaining a multiplicative
                  decomposition of clique and separator potentials. Maintaining
                  a multiplicative decomposition of clique and separator
                  potentials offers a tradeoff between off-line constructed
                  junction trees and on-line exploitation of barren variables
                  and independence relations induced by evidence. We consider
                  the impact of the proposed architecture on a number of
                  commonly performed Bayesian network tasks. The tasks we
                  consider include cautious propagation of evidence, determining
                  a most probable configuration, and fast retraction of evidence
                  a long with a number of other tasks. The general impression is
                  that the proposed architecture increases the computational
                  efficiency of performing these tasks. The efficiency
                  improvement offered by the proposed architecture is emphasized
                  through empirical evaluations involving large real-world
                  Bayesian networks. We compare the time and space performance
                  of the proposed architecture with non-optimized
                  implementations of the HUGIN and Shafer-Shenoy inference

                  control. The algorithm is stated for a feature represented by
                  a general probability density function. Several specific
                  representations are then considered -- Gaussian, discrete,
                  Certainty Grid, and hybrid. Well known algorithms for these
                  representations are shown to fit the general BDDF pattern.
                  Stating the algorithms in Bayesian terms has a practical
                  advantage of allowing a generic software implementation. It is
                  also hoped that a clear general formulation will stimulate
                  extensions to efficient non-parametric representations of
                  arbitrary distributions. The algorithms are described in the

                  parameterized by a single real number between 0 and 1, as a
                  solver for k-SAT problems. In addition, it is shown in

  abstract =     {Based on a recent development in the area of error control
                  coding, we introduce the notion of convolutional factor graphs
                  (CFGs) as a new class of probabilistic graphical models. In
                  this context, the conventional factor graphs are referred to
                  as multiplicative factor graphs (MFGs). This paper shows that
                  CFGs are natural models for probability functions when
                  summation of independent latent random variables is involved.
                  In particular, CFGs capture a large class of linear models,
                  where the linearity is in the sense that the observed
                  variables are obtained as a linear transformation of the
                  latent variables taking arbitrary distributions. We use
                  Gaussian models and independent factor models as examples to
                  demonstrate the use of CFGs. The requirement of a linear
                  transformation between latent variables (with certain
                  independence restriction) and the observed variables, to an
                  extent, limits the modelling flexibility of CFGs. This
                  structural restriction however provides a powerful analytic
                  tool to the framework of CFGs; that is, upon taking the
                  Fourier transform of the function represented by the CFG, the
                  resulting function is represented by a MFG with identical
                  structure. This Fourier transform duality allows inference
                  problems on a CFG to be solved on the corresponding dual MFG.},

                  environments. Observations use dense stereo vision to measure
                  the variance of the heights in each cell of a 2D grid. Unlike
                  other grid-based SLAM algorithms, which use occupancy grid
                  maps, our algorithm uses a new mapping technique that
                  maintains a posterior distribution over the height variance in
                  each cell. To obtain a joint posterior over poses and maps, we
                  use a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter: the pose distribution
                  is estimated using a particle filter, and each particle has
                  its own map that is obtained through exact filtering
                  conditioned on the particle? pose. For the particle filter
                  over pose, visual odometry (VO) provides good proposal
                  distributions. In the analytical (exact) filter for the map,
                  we update the sufficient statistics of a gamma distribution
                  over the precision (inverse variance) of heights in each grid
                  cell. We demonstrate performance on two outdoor courses, and
                  verify the accuracy of the algorithm by comparing with ground
                  truth data obtained using electronic surveying equipment.},

                  they capture the variation in height, represented by a gamma
                  distribution. The mean of the Gaussian height distribution is
                  ignored. It is argued that the height is difficult to
                  determine and not very meaningful given non-flat terrain.
                  Resulting maps for two environments are shown, comparing gamma
                  SLAM with visual odometry. While the maps seem very accurate

  abstract =     {Moving cast shadows are a major concern for foreground
                  detection algorithms. Processing of foreground images in
                  surveillance applications typically requires that such shadows
                  have been identified and removed from the detected foreground.
                  This paper presents a novel pixel-based statistical approach
                  to model moving cast shadows of non-uniform and varying
                  intensity. This approach uses the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
                  learning ability to build statistical models describing moving
                  cast shadows on surfaces. This statistical modeling can deal
                  with scenes with complex and time-varying illumination, and
                  prevent false detection in regions where shadows cannot be
                  detected. Gaussian mixture shadow models (GMSM) are
                  automatically constructed and updated over time, are easily
                  added to a GMM architecture for foreground detection, and
                  require only a small number of parameters. Results obtained
                  with different scene types show the robustness of the
                  approach.},

                  robot that concatenated different wall and midline following
                  behaviours to routes and graphs. The robot was equipped with a
                  ring of ultrasonic sensors and a compass. It executed a single
                  behaviour as long as the sensory conditions remained
                  qualitatively the same, e.g., as long as the robot? ultrasonic
                  sensors detected a corridor leading into the south. A new
                  behaviour was triggered by arriving at a distinctive place
                  showing a qualitative change of the immediate environment such
                  as a corner or a dead end. In contrast to the other
                  approaches, the recognition of these places was only
                  determined by their context, i.e., by the sequence of actions
                  preceding the current action. Thus, the only information
                  stored in the graph representation were actions, not place
                  descriptions. In the graph, each action was labelled by the
                  type of the local environment and by the navigation behaviour
                  used to traverse it (e.g., follow left wall heading south).
                  These features allowed the robot to acquire routes
                  autonomously by simply following the walls of the experimental
                  room. Routes were integrated as soon as the robot encountered
                  a previously visited local environment requiring the same
                  local navigation behaviour. This shows a limitation of
                  Matari�c? approach: The number of uniquely identifiable
                  combinations of wall type and compass direction is small. In
                  general environments, the problem of perceptual aliasing
                  arises, i.e., distinct locations appear identical to the
                  robot? sensors [55]. Arriving at a new situation identical to
                  an already stored one, Matari�c? robot would perform a false
                  route integration. Thus, the navigable environment remained
                  confined to rooms with a uniquely identifiable wall
                  configuration.},

                  visual behaviours is possible from limited representations.
                  One demonstration that this is possible is in driving, where
                  McCallum (1995) demonstrated that a very limited set of
                  sensory information was sufficient to allow a simulated
                  vehicle to learn to drive successfully on a freeway, passing
                  slower cars in front and avoiding faster cars behind. .. The

                  autonomous agent can learn a minimal set of perception?ction

                  reconstruction through visual tracking with a single viewpoint
                  sensor and in particular how to generalise tracking to
                  calibrated omnidirectional cameras.We analyse different
                  minimisation approaches for the intensity-based cost function
                  (sum-ofsquared differences). In particular, we propose novel
                  variants of the efficient second-order minimisation (ESM) with
                  better computational complexities and compare these algorithms
                  with the inverse composition (IC) and the hyperplane
                  approximation (HA). Issues regarding the use of the IC and HA

                  iteration of ESM is more computationally expensive than an
                  iteration of IC, the faster convergence rate makes it globally

                  descriptors derived from multiple views of a scene,
                  incorporating illumination and viewpoint variations. These
                  descriptors are extracted from video and then applied to the
                  challenging task of wide baseline matching across significant
                  viewpoint changes. The system incorporates a single camera on
                  a mobile robot in an extended Kalman filter framework to
                  develop a 3D map of the environment and determine egomotion.
                  At the same time, the feature descriptors are generated from
                  the video sequence, which can be used to localize the robot
                  when it returns to a mapped location. The kidnapped robot
                  problem is addressed by matching descriptors without any
                  estimate of position, then determining the epipolar geometry
                  with respect to a known position in the map.},

                  water at temperatures above 0ºC. In physics, phase diagrams
                  are typically studied using "mean field" or more accurate

  abstract =     {Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are a rapidly growing area of
                  research and development in robotics. For autonomous robot
                  operations, localization has typically been calculated using
                  GPS, external camera arrays, or onboard range or vision
                  sensing. In cluttered indoor or outdoor environments, onboard
                  sensing is the only viable option. In this paper we present an
                  appearance-based approach to visual SLAM on a flying MAV using
                  only low quality vision. Our approach consists of a visual
                  place recognition algorithm that operates on 1000 pixel
                  images, a lightweight visual odometry algorithm, and a visual
                  expectation algorithm that improves the recall of place
                  sequences and the precision with which they are recalled as
                  the robot flies along a similar path. Using data gathered from
                  outdoor datasets, we show that the system is able to perform
                  visual recognition with low quality, intermittent visual
                  sensory data. By combining the visual algorithms with the
                  RatSLAM system, we also demonstrate how the algorithms enable
                  successful SLAM.},

  abstract =     {Learning and then recognizing a route, whether travelled
                  during the day or at night, in clear or inclement weather, and
                  in summer or winter is a challenging task for state of the art
                  algorithms in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we
                  present a new approach to visual navigation under changing
                  conditions dubbed SeqSLAM. Instead of calculating the single
                  location most likely given a current image, our approach
                  calculates the best candidate matching location within every
                  local navigation sequence. Localization is then achieved by
                  recognizing coherent sequences of these #x201C;local best
                  matches #x201D;. This approach removes the need for global
                  matching performance by the vision front-end - instead it must
                  only pick the best match within any short sequence of images.
                  The approach is applicable over environment changes that
                  render traditional feature-based techniques ineffective. Using
                  two car-mounted camera datasets we demonstrate the
                  effectiveness of the algorithm and compare it to one of the
                  most successful feature-based SLAM algorithms, FAB-MAP. The
                  perceptual change in the datasets is extreme; repeated
                  traverses through environments during the day and then in the
                  middle of the night, at times separated by months or years and
                  in opposite seasons, and in clear weather and extremely heavy
                  rain. While the feature-based method fails, the sequence-based
                  algorithm is able to match trajectory segments at 100\%
                  precision with recall rates of up to 60\%.},

                  grammars allow for an efficient representation of such

                  identification and modeling of human actions embedded in a
                  larger sensor stream. Activity discovery can be seen as the
                  inverse of the activity recognition problem. Rather than learn
                  models from hand-labeled sequences, we attempt to discover
                  motifs, sets of similar subsequences within the raw sensor
                  stream, without the benefit of labels or manual segmentation.
                  These motifs are statistically unlikely and thus typically
                  correspond to important or characteristic actions within the
                  activity. The problem of activity discovery differs from
                  typical motif discovery, such as locating protein binding
                  sites, because of the nature of time series data representing
                  human activity. For example, in activity data, motifs will
                  tend to be sparsely distributed, vary in length, and may only
                  exhibit intra-motif similarity after appropriate time warping.
                  In this paper, we motivate the activity discovery problem and
                  present our approach for efficient discovery of meaningful
                  actions from sensor data representing human activity. We
                  empirically evaluate the approach on an exercise data set
                  captured by a wrist-mounted, three-axis inertial sensor. Our
                  algorithm successfully discovers motifs that correspond to the

                  systems. Existing work in the area has mostly addressed scenes
                  that consist of static or quasi-static structures. When the
                  scene exhibits a persistent dynamic behavior in time, such an
                  assumption is violated and detection performance deteriorates.
                  In this paper, we propose a new method for the modeling and
                  subtraction of such scenes. Towards the modeling of the
                  dynamic characteristics, optical flow is computed and utilized
                  as a feature in a higher dimensional space. Inherent
                  ambiguities in the computation of features are addressed by
                  using a data-dependent bandwidth for density estimation using
                  kernels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the utility and

                  motion analysis. The central idea behind such module is to
                  create a probabilistic representation of the static scene that
                  is compared with the current input to perform subtraction.
                  Such approach is efficient when the scene to be modeled refers
                  to a static structure with limited perturbation. In this
                  paper, we address the problem of modeling dynamic scenes where
                  the assumption of a static background is not valid. Waving
                  trees, beaches, escalators, natural scenes with rain or snow
                  are examples. We propose an on-line auto-regressive model to
                  capture and predict the behavior of such scenes. Towards
                  detection of events we introduce a new metric that is based on
                  a state-driven comparison between the prediction and the
                  actual frame. Promising results demonstrate the potentials of
                  the proposed framework.},

                  here considered, mainly for picture processing purposes. A
                  systematic specification and utilization of the available
                  constraints could significantly reduce the amount of search in
                  picture recognition. On the other hand, formally stated
                  constraints can be embedded in the syntactic productions of
                  picture languages. Only binary constraints are treated here,
                  but they are represented in full generality as binary
                  relations. Constraints among more than two variables are then
                  represented as networks of simultaneous binary relations. In
                  general, more than one equivalent (i.e., representing the same
                  constraint) network can be found: a minimal equivalent network
                  is shown to exist, and its computation is shown to solve most
                  practical problems about constraint handling. No exact
                  solution for this central problem was found. Anyway,
                  constraints are treated algebraically, and the solution of a
                  system of linear equations in this algebra provides an
                  approximation of the minimal network. This solution is then
                  proved exact in special cases, e.g., for tree-like and
                  series-parallel networks and for classes of relations for
                  which a distributive property holds. This latter condition is

                  map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key
                  prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few
                  approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large
                  number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman
                  filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic
                  in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor
                  observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that
                  recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over
                  robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically
                  with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is
                  based on an exact factorization of the posterior into a
                  product of conditional landmark distributions and a

  abstract =     {Recent work has shown that the probabilistic SLAM approach of
                  explicit uncertainty propagation can succeed in permitting
                  repeatable 3D real-time localization and mapping even in the
                  'pure vision' domain of a single agile camera with no extra
                  sensing. An issue which has caused difficulty in monocular
                  SLAM however is the initialization of features, since
                  information from multiple images acquired during motion must
                  be combined to achieve accurate depth estimates. This has led
                  algorithms to deviate from the desirable Gaussian uncertainty
                  representation of the EKF and related probabilistic filters
                  during special initialization steps. In this paper we present
                  a new unified parametrization for point features within
                  monocular SLAM which permits efficient and accurate
                  representation of uncertainty during undelayed initialisation
                  and beyond, all within the standard EKF (Extended Kalman
                  Filter). The key concept is direct parametrization of inverse
                  depth, where there is a high degree of linearity. Importantly,
                  our parametrization can cope with features which are so far
                  from the camera that they present little parallax during
                  motion, maintaining sufficient representative uncertainty that
                  these points retain the opportunity to 'come in' from infinity
                  if the camera makes larger movements. We demonstrate the
                  parametrization using real image sequences of large-scale
                  indoor and outdoor scenes.},

                  challenges due to the various uncertainties in the robot

                  of outdoor robots do not always work perfectly, causing large
                  drift in the location estimate of the robot. To overcome this

                  localization using place recognition. First, we learn the
                  location of some arbitrary key places using odometry
                  measurements and GPS measurements only at the start and the
                  end of the robot trajectory. In subsequent runs, when the
                  robot perceives a key place, our fixed-lag smoother fuses
                  odometry measurements with the relative location to the key
                  place to improve its pose estimate. Outdoor mobile robot
                  experiments show that place recognition measurements
                  significantly improve the estimate of the smoother in the

                  computation of two consecutive displacement estimates (both
                  forward and backward in time) these estimates are correlated,
                  and an analysis of the exact structure of the correlations is
                  performed. This analysis is utilized in the design of data
                  fusion algorithms, that correctly account for the existing
                  correlations. We examine two cases: i) pose propagation based

                  fusion of proprioceptive sensor information with

                  (EKF)-based algorithm for real-time vision-aided inertial
                  navigation. The primary contribution of this work is the
                  derivation of a measurement model that is able to express the
                  geometric constraints that arise when a static feature is
                  observed from multiple camera poses. This measurement model
                  does not require including the 3D feature position in the
                  state vector of the EKF and is optimal, up to linearization
                  errors. The vision-aided inertial navigation algorithm we
                  propose has computational complexity only linear in the number
                  of features, and is capable of high-precision pose estimation
                  in large-scale real-world environments. The performance of the
                  algorithm is demonstrated in extensive experimental results,
                  involving a camera/IMU system localizing within an urban
                  area.},

  abstract =     {In this paper, we present a localization algorithm for
                  estimating the 3D position and orientation (pose) of a moving
                  vehicle based on visual and inertial measurements. The main
                  advantage of the proposed method is that it provides precise
                  pose estimates at low computational cost. This is achieved by
                  introducing a two-layer estimation architecture that processes
                  measurements based on their information content. Inertial
                  measurements and feature tracks between consecutive images are
                  processed locally in the first layer (Multi-State-Constraint
                  Kalman filter) providing estimates for the motion of the
                  vehicle at a high rate. The second layer comprises a bundle
                  adjustment iterative estimator that operates intermittently so
                  as to (i) reduce the effect of the linearization errors, and
                  (ii) update the state estimates every time an area is
                  re-visited and features are re-detected (loop closure).
                  Through this process reliable state estimates are available
                  continuously, while the estimation errors remain bounded
                  during long-term operation. The performance of the developed
                  system is demonstrated in large-scale experiments, involving a
                  vehicle localizing within an urban area.},

  abstract =     {In recent years, autonomous miniature airships have gained
                  increased interest in the robotics community. This is due to
                  their ability to move safely and hover for extended periods of
                  time. The major constraints of miniature airships come from
                  their limited payload which introduces substantial constraints
                  on their perceptional capabilities. In this paper, we consider
                  the problem of localizing a miniature blimp with lightweight
                  ultrasound sensors. Since the opening angle of the sound cone
                  emitted by a sonar sensor depends on the diameter of the
                  membrane, small-size sonar devices introduce the problem of
                  high uncertainty about which object has been perceived. We
                  present a novel sensor model for ultrasound sensors with large
                  opening angles that allows an autonomous blimp to robustly
                  localize itself in a known environment using Monte Carlo
                  localization. As we demonstrate in experiments with a real
                  blimp, our novel sensor model outperforms a popular sensor
                  model that has in the past been shown to work reliably on
                  wheeled platforms.},

  abstract =     {Rescue robotics has been suggested by a recent DARPA/NSF study
                  as an application domain for the research in human-robot
                  integration (HRI). This paper provides a short tutorial on how
                  robots are currently used in urban search and rescue (USAR)
                  and discusses the HRI issues encountered over the past eight
                  years. A domain theory of the search activity is formulated.
                  The domain theory consists of two parts: 1) a workflow model
                  identifying the major tasks, actions, and roles in
                  robot-assisted search (e.g., a workflow model) and 2) a
                  general information flow model of how data from the robot is
                  fused by various team members into information and knowledge.
                  The information flow model also captures the types of
                  situation awareness needed by each agent in the rescue robot
                  system. The article presents a synopsis of the major HRI
                  issues in reducing the number of humans it takes to control a
                  robot, maintaining performance with geographically distributed
                  teams with intermittent communications, and encouraging
                  acceptance within the existing social structure.},

                  accurate depth images at 2 Hz allowing it to safely travel
                  through the environment at 0.5 m/s. The algorithm integrates
                  stereo vision, occupancy grid mapping, and potential field
                  path planning techniques to form a robust and cohesive robotic
                  system for mapping and navigation. Stereo vision is shown to

                  sonar and laser range finders.},

                  and control for a modular wheeled mobile robot (WMR) is
                  addressed. This is a vehicle system with nonlinear kinematics,
                  distributed multiple sensors, and nonlinear sensor models. The
                  problem is solved by applying fully decentralized estimation
                  and control algorithms based on the extended information
                  filter. This is achieved by deriving a modular, decentralized
                  kinematic model by using plane motion kinematics to obtain the
                  forward and inverse kinematics for a generalized simple
                  wheeled vehicle. This model is then used in the decentralized
                  estimation and control algorithms. WMR estimation and control
                  is thus obtained locally using reduced order models with
                  reduced communication requirements, in a scalable network of
                  control nodes. If communication of information between nodes
                  is carried out after every measurement (full rate
                  communication), the estimates and control signals obtained at
                  each node are equivalent to those obtained by a corresponding
                  centralized system. Transputer architecture is used as the
                  basis for hardware and software design as it supports the
                  extensive communication and concurrency requirements that
                  characterize modular and decentralized systems. The advantages
                  of a modular WMR vehicle include scalability, application
                  flexibility, low prototyping costs, and high reliability.},

                  assume that the scene and the sources are immersed in pure air
                  and that light is neither scattered nor absorbed. Recently,
                  however, structured lighting has found growing application in
                  underwater and aerial imaging, where scattering effects cannot
                  be ignored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
                  of two representative methods - light stripe range scanning
                  and photometric stereo - in the presence of scattering. For
                  both methods, we derive physical models for the appearances of
                  a surface immersed in a scattering medium. Based on these
                  models, we present results on (a) the condition for object
                  detectability in light striping and (b) the number of sources
                  required for photometric stereo. In both cases, we demonstrate
                  that while traditional methods fail when scattering is
                  significant, our methods accurately recover the scene (depths,
                  normals, albedos) as well as the properties of the medium.
                  These results are in turn used to restore the appearances of
                  scenes as if they were captured in clear air. Although we have
                  focused on light striping and photometric stereo, our approach
                  can also be extended to other methods such as grid coding,

                  Homing is accomplished without the use of an explicit world

                  analysis of the associative memory used in his approach.
                  Instead of a mobile robot, Nelson used a small camera mounted
                  on a robot arm which could move at a fixed height over a
                  miniature city called ?inytown? Places were recognized from
                  the bird? eye view of the camera. Each camera image of a
                  location was divided into a 5 ?5 grid of adjacent subwindows
                  in which the predominant edge direction was determined. In the
                  training phase, Nelson? system learned associations between
                  local edge orientation patterns with directions towards the
                  goal in the town centre at 120 preselected places covering
                  Tinytown. Homing was accomplished by comparing the currently
                  perceived pattern against all patterns stored in the
                  associative memory, and moving into the specified direction of
                  the winning pattern. Nelson? system was able to find the goal
                  from almost all places in Tinytown and thus demonstrated the
                  feasability of recognition-triggered responses in robot
                  applications. However, his system relied on some
                  idealizations: pictures were taken in exactly the same camera
                  orientation, the system had to be trained at all possible
                  locations and could not select places autonomously.}

                  opposed to centralized MAP-based CL, the proposed algorithm
                  reduces the memory and processing requirements by distributing
                  data and computations amongst the robots. Specifically, a
                  distributed data-allocation scheme is presented that enables
                  robots to simultaneously process and update their local data.
                  Additionally, a distributed Conjugate Gradient algorithm is
                  employed that reduces the cost of computing the MAP estimates,
                  while utilizing all available resources in the team and
                  increasing robustness to single-point failures. Finally, a
                  computationally efficient distributed marginalization of past

  abstract =     {This paper presents a closed form solution to the multiple
                  platform simultaneous localisation and map building (SLAM)
                  problem. Closed form solutions are presented in both state
                  space and information based forms. A key conclusion of this
                  paper is that the information-state based form offers many
                  advantages over the state space formulation in allowing the
                  SLAM algorithm to be decentralised across multiple platforms.
                  The benefits of operating SLAM in an information form are
                  numerous. The additive properties of the information update
                  make it especially attractive, as does the ability to predict
                  estimates through any direction in time. However, of paramount
                  importance is the well-known ability to decentralise the
                  information filter. A general form of the continuous time
                  inverse covariance matrix for the SLAM problem is presented to
                  determine such properties as the initial and steady state
                  conditions. These properties are investigated to determine
                  their dependence and relationship to both the observation and
                  process noise. Examination of the structure of the general
                  form of the inverse covariance matrix also gives an insight
                  into what information should be communicated between platforms
                  in the decentralised architecture and how it can be managed.},
  c-nettleton03fsr ={The update of the information form is additive; as a
                  result, incremental new information can be integrated across
                  different vehicles with arbitrary network latencies. However,
                  our previous work required communication bandwidths quadratic
                  in the size of the map.},
  c-rosencrantz03uai ={In a recent result [this], it was shown that scalable
                  decentralized state estimation can be achieved for static
                  environments with Gaussian error - that is, environments where
                  the state does not change over time and observations are
                  (approximately) linear functions of the state with Gaussian
                  error. The key insight in [this] is that in static worlds,
                  information can be accumulated at any time and in any order,
                  regardless of the time at which it was acquired. Furthermore,
                  because of the simple form of the observations, there is a
                  simple algorithm for accumulating local evidence in the form
                  of additive information matrices. Unfortunately, the "trick"
                  of additive information works only for distributions (such as
                  Gaussians) which are in the exponential family.},

                  the communication bandwidth is limited. We present a novel
                  SLAM algorithm that enables multiple vehicles to acquire a
                  joint map, but which can cope with arbitrary latency and
                  bandwidth limitations such as typically found in airborne
                  vehicle applications. The key idea is to represent maps in
                  information form (negative log-likelihood), and to selectively
                  communicate subsets of the information tailored to the
                  available communication resources. We show that our
                  communication scheme preserves the consistency, which has
                  important ramifications for data association problems. We also

                  an actuated laser scanner and camera installed on a mobile
                  robot. The laser samples the local geometry of the environment
                  and is used to incrementally build a 3D point-cloud map of the
                  workspace. Sequences of images from the camera are used to
                  detect loop closure events (without reference to the internal
                  estimates of vehicle location) using a novel appearance-based
                  retrieval system. The loop closure detection is robust to
                  repetitive visual structure and provides a probabilistic
                  measure of confidence. The images suggesting loop closure are
                  then further processed with their corresponding local laser
                  scans to yield putative Euclidean image-image transformations.
                  We show how naive application of this transformation to effect
                  the loop closure can lead to catastrophic linearization errors
                  and go on to describe a way in which gross, pre-loop closing
                  errors can be successfully annulled. We demonstrate our system
                  working in a challenging, outdoor setting containing
                  substantial loops and beguiling, gently curving traversals.
                  The results are overlaid on an aerial image to provide a
                  ground truth comparison with the estimated map. The paper

                  or a single moving camera based on video input. The system
                  operates in real-time with low delay and the motion estimates
                  are used for navigational purposes. The front end of the
                  system is a feature tracker. Point features are matched
                  between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at
                  video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then
                  produced from the feature tracks using a geometric
                  hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates what we call
                  visual odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input

                  necessary. The visual odometry can also be used in conjunction
                  with information from other sources such as GPS, inertia
                  sensors, wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has
                  been applied successfully to video from aerial, automotive and
                  handheld platforms. We focus on results with an autonomous
                  ground vehicle. We give examples of camera trajectories

                  in connection with the 5-point and 3-point algorithm,

                  to the monocular algorithm, the stereo version exhibits no

                  epipolar geometry with applications to autonomous vehicle
                  navigation. Such uncertainty information is necessary for
                  making informed decisions regarding the confidence of a motion
                  estimate, since we must otherwise accept the estimate without
                  any knowledge of the probability that the estimate is in
                  error. For example, we may wish to fuse visual estimates with
                  information from GPS and inertial sensors, but without
                  uncertainty information, we have no principled way to do so.
                  Ideally, we would perform a full search over the 7-dimensional
                  space of fundamental matrices to yield an estimate and its
                  related uncertainty. However, searching this space is
                  computationally infeasible. As a compromise between fully
                  representing posterior likelihood over this space and
                  producing a single estimate, we represent the uncertainty over
                  the space of translation directions in a calibrated framework.
                  In contrast to finding a single estimate, representing the
                  posterior likelihood is always a well-posed problem, albeit an
                  often computationally challenging one. Given the posterior
                  likelihood, we derive a confidence interval around the motion
                  estimate. We verify the correctness of the confidence interval
                  using synthetic data and show examples of uncertainty
                  estimates using vehicle-mounted camera sequences.},

                  or a single moving camera based on video input. The system
                  operates in real-time with low delay and the motion estimates
                  are used for navigational purposes. The front end of the
                  system is a feature tracker. Point features are matched
                  between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at
                  video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then
                  produced from the feature tracks using a geometric
                  hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates motion
                  estimates from visual input alone. No prior knowledge of the

                  robot executes it's plan the failure may occur and the the
                  planner is reinitiated. There is a lot of planning going on
                  which may be quite time consuming also robots are assigned
                  priorities in the allocation phase. Is a good idea?
                  Negotiation is going on only on the symbolic level and is to
                  certain extent recursive. For the cooperation, we may need
                  somthing on the sensory level. Pusher and Supervisor Example.

  abstract =     {Architectural legibility is the degree to which the designed
                  features of the environment aid people in creating an
                  effective mental image, or "cognitive map" of the spatial
                  relationships within a building, and the subsequent ease of
                  wayfinding within the environment. However, little research
                  has attempted to operationalize legibility by examining the
                  relationship between objective measures of the physical
                  environment, the cognitive map, and observational measures of
                  wayfinding performance. This article empirically assesses the
                  effects of one environmental variable, topological floor plan
                  complexity, on the cognitive mapping and wayfinding
                  performance of 63 participants within three building settings.
                  The study finds that this objective measure of floor plan
                  complexity significantly influences cognitive mapping and
                  observed wayfinding. Given these results, a conceptual model
                  of one aspect of architectural legibility was developed and
                  empirically tested. Path analysis was used to assess the
                  relationship between topological plan configuration, four
                  convergent measures of the cognitive map, and observational
                  measures of human wayfinding performance. Analysis of these
                  data provide support for the conceptual model. The model
                  suggests that the complexity of topological plan configuration
                  influences legibility. The evidence also indicates that the
                  relationship between plan configuration and wayfinding is
                  mediated by the accuracy of the cognitive map.},

                  surveillance systems. One dificult problem when using the
                  process is maintaining a correct background image against
                  changing illumination conditions. Most methods for maintaining
                  the background image are based on intuitive definitions about
                  the illumination change and are implemented as somewhat ad hoc
                  algorithms. In contrast, we first define mathematical models
                  representing the relation between the illumination intensity,
                  a rejection index of objects and a pixel value. We also
                  mathematically define an assumption about illumination, which
                  requires that the distribution of the illumination intensity
                  in a small region does not change Then we formalize the
                  background subtraction problem as a statistical test based on
                  the models and assunip tion. The experinients show that our
                  models appropriately express the imaging process of a camera
                  and our method' provides stable detection performance for

  abstract =     {We describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning
                  system for modeling and recognizing human behaviors in a
                  visual surveillance task. The system is particularly concerned
                  with detecting when interactions between people occur and
                  classifying the type of interaction. Examples of interesting
                  interaction behaviors include following another person,
                  altering one's path to meet another, and so forth. Our system
                  combines top-down with bottom-up information in a closed
                  feedback loop, with both components employing a statistical
                  Bayesian approach. We propose and compare two different
                  state-based learning architectures, namely, HMMs and CHMMs for
                  modeling behaviors and interactions. The CHMM model is shown
                  to work much more efficiently and accurately. Finally, to deal
                  with the problem of limited training data, a synthetic
                  Alife-style training system is used to develop flexible prior
                  models for recognizing human interactions. We demonstrate the
                  ability to use these a priori models to accurately classify
                  real human behaviors and interactions with no additional
                  tuning or training.},

                  and the relative positions of features in the environment.
                  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms
                  attempt to fuse these estimates to produce a map and a robot
                  trajectory. The constraints are generally non-linear, thus
                  SLAM can be viewed as a non-linear optimization problem. The
                  optimization can be difficult, due to poor initial estimates
                  arising from odometry data, and due to the size of the state
                  space. We present a fast non-linear optimization algorithm
                  that rapidly recovers the robot trajectory, even when given a
                  poor initial estimate. Our approach uses a variant of
                  Stochastic Gradient Descent on an alternative state-space
                  representation that has good stability and computational
                  properties.We compare our algorithm to several others, using

  abstract =     {Background subtraction is a widely used paradigm to detect
                  moving objects in video taken from a static camera and is used
                  for various important applications such as video surveillance,
                  human motion analysis, etc. Various statistical approaches
                  have been proposed for modeling a given scene background.
                  However, there is no theoretical framework for choosing which
                  features to use to model different regions of the scene
                  background. In this paper we introduce a novel framework for
                  feature selection for background modeling and subtraction. A
                  boosting algorithm, namely RealBoost, is used to choose the
                  best combination of features at each pixel. Given the
                  probability estimates from a pool of features calculated by
                  Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) over a certain time period, the
                  algorithm selects the most useful ones to discriminate
                  foreground objects from the scene background. The results show
                  that the proposed framework successfully selects appropriate
                  features for different parts of the image.},

  abstract =     {Probabilistic inference problems arise naturally in
                  distributed systems such as sensor networks and teams of
                  mobile robots. Inference algorithms that use message passing
                  are a natural fit for distributed systems, but they must be
                  robust to the failure situations that arise in real-world
                  settings, such as unreliable communication and node failures.
                  Unfortunately, the popular sum-product algorithm can yield
                  very poor estimates in these settings because the nodes'
                  beliefs before convergence can be arbitrarily different from
                  the correct posteriors. In this paper, we present a new
                  message passing algorithm for probabilistic inference which
                  provides several crucial guarantees that the standard
                  sum-product algorithm does not. Not only does it converge to
                  the correct posteriors, but it is also guaranteed to yield a
                  principled approximation at any point before convergence. In
                  addition, the computational complexity of the message passing
                  updates depends only upon the model, and is independent of the
                  network topology of the distributed system. We demonstrate the
                  approach with detailed experimental results on a distributed
                  sensor calibration task using data from an actual sensor

  abstract =     {Many inference problems that arise in sensor networks require
                  the computation of a global conclusion that is consistent with
                  local information known to each node. A large class of these
                  problems - including probabilistic inference, regression, and
                  control problems - can be solved by message passing on a data
                  structure called a junction tree. In this paper, we present a
                  distributed architecture for solving these problems that is
                  robust to unreliable communication and node failures. In this
                  architecture, the nodes of the sensor network assemble
                  themselves into a junction tree and exchange messages between
                  neighbors to solve the inference problem efficiently and
                  exactly. A key part of the architecture is an efficient
                  distributed algorithm for optimizing the choice of junction
                  tree to minimize the communication and computation required by
                  inference. We present experimental results from a prototype
                  implementation on a 97-node Mica2 mote network, as well as
                  simulation results for three applications: distributed sensor
                  calibration, optimal control, and sensor field modeling. These
                  experiments demonstrate that our distributed architecture can
                  solve many important inference problems exactly, efficiently,
                  and robustly.},

  abstract =     {In this paper we describe a system that carries out SLAM using
                  a stereo pair moving with 6DOF as the only sensor. Textured
                  point features are extracted from the images and stored as 3D
                  points if seen in both images with sufficient disparity, or
                  stored as inverse 3D points otherwise. This allows the system
                  to make use of both near and far features that provide
                  distance and orientation, or orientation information,
                  respectively. Unlike other vision only SLAM systems, stereo
                  does not suffer from ?cale drift?because of unobservability
                  problems, and thus no other information such as gyroscopes or
                  accelerometers is required. Our SLAM algorithm generates
                  sequences of conditionally independent local maps that can
                  share information related to the camera motion and common
                  features being tracked. The system computes the full map using
                  the Divide and Conquer algorithm adapted for conditionally
                  independent local maps, allowing linear time execution. We
                  show experimental results in outdoor urban environments that
                  demonstrate the robustness and scalability of our system.},

  year =         2008,

  abstract =     {Recent successful SLAM methods employ hybrid map
                  representations combining the strengths of topological maps
                  and occupancy grids. Such representations often facilitate
                  multi-agent mapping. In this paper, a successful SLAM method
                  is presented, which is inspired by the manifold data structure
                  by Howard et al. This method maintains a graph with sensor
                  observations stored in vertices and pose differences including
                  uncertainty information stored in edges. Through its graph
                  structure, updates are local and can be efficiently
                  communicated to peers. The graph links represent known
                  traversable space, and facilitate tasks like path planning. We
                  demonstrate that our SLAM method produces very detailed maps
                  without sacrificing scalability. The presented method was used
                  by the UvA Rescue Virtual Robots team, which won the Best
                  Mapping Award in the RoboCup Rescue Virtual Robots competition

  abstract =     {Robotic underwater vehicles are regularly performing vast
                  optical surveys of the ocean floor. Scientists value these
                  surveys since optical images offer high levels of detail and
                  are easily interpreted by humans. Unfortunately, the coverage
                  of a single image is limited by absorption and backscatter
                  while what is generally desired is an overall view of the
                  survey area. Recent works on underwater mosaics assume planar
                  scenes and are applicable only to situations without much
                  relief. We present a complete and validated system for
                  processing optical images acquired from an underwater robotic
                  vehicle to form a 3D reconstruction of the ocean floor. Our
                  approach is designed for the most general conditions of
                  wide-baseline imagery (low overlap and presence of significant
                  3D structure) and scales to hundreds or thousands of images.
                  We only assume a calibrated camera system and a vehicle with
                  uncertain and possibly drifting pose information (e.g., a
                  compass, depth sensor, and a Doppler velocity log). Our
                  approach is based on a combination of techniques from computer
                  vision, photogrammetry, and robotics. We use a local to global
                  approach to structure from motion, aided by the navigation
                  sensors on the vehicle to generate 3D sub-maps. These sub-maps
                  are then placed in a common reference frame that is refined by
                  matching overlapping sub-maps. The final stage of processing
                  is a bundle adjustment that provides the 3D structure, camera
                  poses, and uncertainty estimates in a consistent reference
                  frame. We present results with ground truth for structure as
                  well as results from an oceanographic survey over a coral
                  reef.},

                  the basis of their shape poses at least two difficult
                  problems. First, there is the problem of variable
                  illumination, which can be addressed by working with
                  relatively stable features such as intensity edges rather than
                  the raw intensity images. Second, there is the problem of the
                  initially unknown pose of the object relative to the viewer.
                  In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made
                  about the viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object
                  from such a viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual
                  image. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D models of
                  objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself a
                  difficult problem. To address this problem in computational
                  vision, we have developed a scheme, based on the theory of
                  approximation of multivariate functions, that learns from a
                  small set of perspective views a function mapping any
                  viewpoint to a standard view. A network equivalent to this
                  scheme will thus 'recognize' the object on which it was
                  trained from any viewpoint.},

                  in a video sequence by taking advantage of the statistical
                  prevalence of the shadowed regions over the object regions. We
                  model shadows using multivariate Gaussians. We apply a weak
                  classifier as a prefilter. We project shadow models into a
                  quantized color space to update a shadow flow function. We use
                  shadow flow, background models, and current frame to determine
                  the shadow and object regions. This method has several
                  advantages: It does not require a color space transformation.
                  We pose the problem in the RGB color space, and we can carry
                  out the same analysis in other Cartesian spaces as well. It is
                  data-driven and adapts to the changing shadow conditions. In
                  other words, accuracy of our method is not limited by the
                  preset values. Furthermore, it does not assume any 3D models
                  for the target objects or tracking of the cast shadows between
                  frames. Our results show that the detection performance is
                  superior than the benchmark method.},

                  viewing perspectives is an important requirement for many
                  computer vision applications. One of the key factors in
                  enhancing the robustness of dynamic scene analysis is that of
                  accurate and reliable means for shadow detection. Shadow
                  detection is critical for correct object detection in image
                  sequences. Many algorithms have been proposed in the
                  literature that deal with shadows. However, a comparative
                  evaluation of the existing approaches is still lacking. In
                  this paper, the full range of problems underlying the shadow
                  detection are identified and discussed. We classify the
                  proposed solutions to this problem using a taxonomy of four
                  main classes, called deterministic model and non-model based
                  and statistical parametric and non- parametric. Novel
                  quantitative (detection and discrimination accuracy) and
                  qualitative metrics (scene and object independence,
                  flexibility to shadow situations and robustness to noise) are

                  detection is critical for accurate object detection in video
                  streams since shadow points are often misclassified as object
                  points, causing errors in segmentation and tracking. Many
                  algorithms have been proposed in the literature that deal with
                  shadows. However, a comparative evaluation of the existing
                  approaches is still lacking. In this paper, we present a
                  comprehensive survey of moving shadow detection approaches. We
                  organize contributions reported in the literature in four
                  classes two of them are statistical and two are deterministic.
                  We also present a comparative empirical evaluation of

  abstract =     {The objective of this work is to enlarge the class of camera
                  motions for which epipolar geometry and image correspondences
                  can be computed automatically. This facilitates matching
                  between quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two
                  extensions are made to the current small baseline algorithms:
                  first, and most importantly, a viewpoint invariant measure is
                  developed for assessing the affinity of corner neighbourhoods
                  over image pairs; second, algorithms are given for generating
                  putative corner matches between image pairs using local
                  homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments are also
                  described: the automatic generation of local homographies, and
                  the combination of possibly conflicting sets of matches prior
                  to RANSAC estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is
                  demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying relative
                  motion, and for different scene types. All processing is
                  automatic},

                  probabilistic methods exist for topological maps. We present
                  the concept of Probabilistic Topological Maps (PTMs), a

                  distribution over topologies given the available sensor

                  investigated extensively for performing inference over the
                  space of metric maps, no corresponding general purpose methods
                  exist for topological maps. We present the concept of
                  Probabilistic Topological Maps (PTMs), a sample-based
                  representation that approximates the posterior distribution
                  over topologies given available sensor measurements. We show
                  that the space of topologies is equivalent to the intractably
                  large space of set partitions on the set of available
                  measurements. The combinatorial nature of the problem is
                  overcome by computing an approximate, sample-based
                  representation of the posterior. The PTM is obtained by
                  performing Bayesian inference over the space of all possible
                  topologies and provides a systematic solution to the problem
                  of perceptual aliasing in the domain of topological mapping.
                  In this paper, we describe a general framework for modeling
                  measurements, and the use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
                  algorithm that uses specific instances of these models for
                  odometry and appearance measurements to estimate the posterior
                  distribution. We present experimental results that validate
                  our technique and generate good maps when using odometry and
                  appearance, derived from panoramic images, as sensor

                  Mapping (SLAM) problem in robotics are superior to the more
                  common filtering approaches in being exact, better equipped to
                  deal with non-linearities, and computing the entire robot
                  trajectory. However, while filtering algorithms that perform
                  map updates in constant time exist, no analogous smoothing
                  method is available. We aim to rectify this situation by
                  presenting a smoothingbased solution to SLAM using Loopy
                  Belief Propagation (LBP) that can perform the trajectory and
                  map updates in constant time except when a loop is closed in
                  the environment. The SLAM problem is represented as a Gaussian
                  Markov Random Field (GMRF) over which LBP is performed. We
                  prove that LBP, in this case, is equivalent to Gauss-Seidel
                  relaxation of a linear system. The inability to compute
                  marginal covariances efficiently in a smoothing algorithm has
                  previously been a stumbling block to their widespread use. LBP
                  enables the efficient recovery of the marginal covariances,
                  albeit approximately, of landmarks and poses. While the final
                  covariances are overconfident, the ones obtained from a
                  spanning tree of the GMRF are conservative, making them useful
                  for data association. Experiments in simulation and using real

                  of measurements from multiple asynchronous measurement sources
                  in an optimal manner. Since robots usually have a plurality of
                  uncoordinated sensors, our algorithm has an advantage over
                  filtering-based estimation algorithms, which cannot
                  incorporate delayed measurements optimally. We provide an
                  implementation of the general fixed-lag smoothing algorithm
                  using square root smoothing, a technique that has recently
                  become prominent. Square root smoothing uses fast sparse
                  matrix factorization and enables our fixed-lag pose estimation
                  algorithm to run at upwards of 20 Hz. Our algorithm has been

                  Kalman filter algorithm amongst the sensing nodes of a
                  multisensor system is preserved. This algorithm does not
                  require any form of central processing facility or centralised
                  communications medium. Each sensing node implements its own
                  local Kalman filter to arrive at a partial decision which it
                  then broadcasts to every other node. Each node then
                  assimilates this received information to arrive at its own
                  local estimate of the system state. The algorithm guarantees
                  that each local estimate thus obtained is identical to the
                  estimate that would be obtained if a conventional, completely
                  centralised, Kalman filter were used. Because there is no
                  single central processing node the algorithm is highly
                  resilient to loss of one or more sensing nodes. The fully
                  decentralised nature ensures that it is ideal for
                  implementation on a parallel processing array, such as a
                  transputer network. The algorithm has been tested using a

                  decentralized multi-sensor systems. Decentralized
                  architectures have many benefits in terms of modularity, speed
                  and robustness. The state estimation (tracking) algorithm is a
                  decentralized Kalman filter (DKF) based on the extended Kalman
                  filter. Identification is achieved by the decentralized
                  Bayesian identification (DBI) algorithm, which identifies
                  targets being tracked. For each of the algorithms The authors
                  discuss optimality and the effect of reducing connectivity.
                  The structure of the algorithms leads to the development of an
                  architecture for a modular sensing node based on communication
                  considerations. The authors present example implementations of
                  both algorithms on actual transputer-based sensing nodes. They
                  describe RCD (region of constant depth) tracking and for this
                  develop a monopulse sonar arrangement with which they
                  implement real-time autonomous tracking by a single sensor
                  node. The second example implementation describes
                  identification of targets being tracked by the DKF using the
                  DBI on actual CCD camera-based nodes},

                  that DKF is just an instance of DBI (although, I did not fully

                  multirobot exploration. The approach is based on using pairs
                  of robots that observe each other's behavior, acting in
                  concert to reduce odometry errors. We assume the robots can
                  both directly sense nearby obstacles and see each other. This
                  allows the robots to obtain a map of higher accuracy than
                  would be possible with robots acting independently by reducing
                  inaccuracies that occur over time from dead reckoning errors.
                  Furthermore, by exploiting the ability of the robots to see

  abstract =     {LAMA is a classical planning system based on heuristic forward
                  search. Its core feature is the use of a pseudo-heuristic
                  derived from landmarks, propositional formulas that must be
                  true in every solution of a planning task. LAMA builds on the
                  Fast Downward planning system, using finite-domain rather than
                  binary state variables and multi-heuristic search. The latter
                  is employed to combine the landmark heuristic with a variant
                  of the well-known FF heuristic. Both heuristics are
                  cost-sensitive, focusing on high-quality solutions in the case
                  where actions have non-uniform cost. A weighted A* search is
                  used with iteratively decreasing weights, so that the planner
                  continues to search for plans of better quality until the
                  search is terminated. \\ LAMA showed best performance among
                  all planners in the sequential satisficing track of the
                  International Planning Competition 2008. In this paper we
                  present the system in detail and investigate which features of
                  LAMA are crucial for its performance. We present individual
                  results for some of the domains used at the competition,
                  demonstrating good and bad cases for the techniques
                  implemented in LAMA. Overall, we find that using landmarks
                  improves performance, whereas the incorporation of action
                  costs into the heuristic estimators proves not to be
                  beneficial. We show that in some domains a search that ignores
                  cost solves far more problems, raising the question of how to
                  deal with action costs more effectively in the future. The
                  iterated weighted A* search greatly improves results, and
                  shows synergy effects with the use of landmarks.},

                  tracking and identification. The theoretical methods employed
                  for studying decentralised data fusion problems are based on
                  the information-filter formulation of the Kalman filter
                  algorithm and on information-theoretic methods derived from
                  the Bayes theorem. The paper particularly focuses on how these
                  methods are applied in very large heterogeneous sensor
                  networks, where there may be a significant amount of data
                  delay or corruption in communication. This paper then
                  describes the development of a practical system aimed at
                  demonstrating some of these principles. The system consists of
                  a number of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), with radar and
                  vision payloads, able to observe a number of ground targets.

                  with the ability to communicate in a network with both other
                  air-borne and other ground sensors. The ground sensor system

                  vision scanned laser, steerable radar, multiple fixed radar

  r-mateescu07ijcai ={Variable Elimination and Conditioning (VEC) is an
                  algorithm that combines the virtues of both inference and
                  search. One of its remarkably successful applications is the
                  genetic linkage analysis software Superlink \cite{Fishelson
                  and Geiger, 2002}. VEC works by interleaving elimination and
                  conditioning of variables. Typically, given an ordering, it
                  prefers the elimina- tion of a variable whenever possible, and
                  switches to conditioning whenever space limitations require
                  it, and continues in the same manner until all variables have
                  been processed.}

                  scenes. In \cite{Robertson04bmvc} the authors used vertical

                  presence of dominant plane and hence was applicable to
                  scenarios with dominant building facades. The actual

                  in this paper are related to the study of the following
                  question. Given an $n\times n$ positive definite matrix $M$
                  that is sparse (many zero entries), which of the matrices
                  $PMP^T$ ($P$ an $n\times n$ permutation matrix) should we use
                  to solve a system equivalent to $Mx=b$ by Gaussian
                  elimination? S. V. Parter \cite{Parter61siam} discussed this
                  question when $M$ was represented by a tree, and he showed
                  that an ordering $P$ could be found which resulted in a
                  `perfect' elimination scheme. Our results show this is true
                  more generally when $M$ can be represented by a triangulated
                  graph. We present here only the theoretical aspects of
                  elimination and will present elsewhere the applications of
                  this analysis to the study of efficient numerical solution of

                  are characterized by probability distributions whose factor
                  graph representations are sparse and whose factors are all
                  Gaussian functions of error residuals. Under these conditions,
                  maximum likelihood estimation corresponds to solving a
                  sequence of sparse least-squares minimization problems in
                  which additional summands are added to the objective function
                  over time. In this paper we present Robust Incremental
                  least-Squares Estimation (RISE), an incrementalized version of
                  the Powell's Dog-Leg trust-region method suitable for use in
                  online sparse least-squares minimization. As a trust-region
                  method, Powell's Dog-Leg enjoys excellent global convergence
                  properties, and is known to be considerably faster than both
                  Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt when applied to sparse
                  least-squares problems. Consequently, RISE maintains the speed
                  of current state-of-the-art incremental sparse least-squares
                  methods while providing superior robustness to objective

                  decentralized state estimation from multiple platforms in
                  dynamic environments. As has long been recognized, centralized
                  architectures impose severe scaling limitations for
                  distributed systems due to the enormous communication
                  overheads. We propose a strictly decentralized approach in
                  which only nearby platforms exchange information. They do so
                  through an interactive communication protocol aimed at
                  maximizing information flow. Our approach is evaluated in the
                  context of a distributed surveillance scenario that arises in
                  a robotic system for playing the game of laser tag. Our
                  results, both from simulation and using physical robots,
                  illustrate an unprecedented scaling capability to large teams
                  of vehicles.},

                  one class of algorithms for an important class of discrete
                  optimization problems. We consider discrete, multivariate,
                  optimization problems in which the objective function is given
                  as a sum of terms. Each term is a function of only a subset of
                  the variables. We first consider a class of optimization
                  algorithms which eliminate suboptimal solutions by comparing
                  the objective function on "comparable" partial solutions. A
                  large, natural subclass of comparison algorithms in which the
                  subproblems considered are either nested or nonadjacent (i.e.,
                  noninteracting) is then defined. It is shown that a
                  variable-elimination procedure, nonserial dynamic programming,
                  is optimal in an extremely strong sense among all algorithms

                  studied independent of any specific ongoing task and limited

                  use in everyday life, which mostly consists of purposeful
                  tasks where gaze is crucially involved. To better understand
                  deployment of gaze under such circumstances, we devised a
                  series of experiments, in which subjects navigated along a
                  walkway in a virtual environment and executed combinations of
                  approach and avoidance tasks. The position of the body and the
                  gaze were monitored during the execution of the task
                  combinations and dependence of gaze on the ongoing tasks as
                  well as the visual features of the scene was analyzed. Gaze

                  localizing a group of mobile robots capable of sensing each
                  other. Each of the robots collects sensor data regarding its
                  own motion and shares this information with the rest of the
                  team during the update cycles. A single estimator, in the form
                  of a Kalman filter, processes the available positioning
                  information from all the members of the team and produces a
                  pose estimate for each of them. The equations for this
                  centralized estimator can be written in a decentralized form
                  thus allowing this single Kalman filter to be decomposed into
                  a number of smaller communicating filters, each of them
                  processing local data for most of the time. The resulting
                  decentralized estimation scheme constitutes a unique mean for
                  fusing measurements collected from a variety of sensors with
                  minimal communication and processing requirements. The
                  distributed localization algorithm is applied to a group of 3

                  results for an improvement, in terms of both efficiency and
                  robustness, of our early multi-view ICP randomized algorithm.
                  Instead of minimizing an ICP-based cost, we propose the
                  minimization of the entropy of the 2D distribution induced by
                  the projection of the 3D point cloud. In addition we embed
                  both the egomotion/action estimation algorithm which precedes
                  global rectification and the new global rectification
                  algorithm in an autonomous exploration schema. We assume
                  plane-parallel environments and, for the sake of efficiency,
                  we also assume a flat floor and a fixed stereo camera mounted
                  on the robot. We show successful experiments both under

                  class of interest-point-based features that are stable under
                  significant changes in scale, viewpoint, and illumination,
                  making them ideally suited to landmark-based navigation.
                  Although many such features may be visible in a given view of
                  the robot? environment, only a few such features are necessary
                  to estimate the robot? position and orientation. In this
                  paper, we address the problem of automatically selecting, from
                  the entire set of features visible in the robot? environment,
                  the minimum (optimal) set by which the robot can navigate its
                  environment. Specifically, we decompose the world into a small
                  number of maximally sized regions, such that at each position
                  in a given region, the same small set of features is visible.
                  We introduce a novel graph theoretic formulation of the
                  problem, and prove that it is NP-complete. Next, we introduce
                  a number of approximation algorithms and evaluate them on both
                  synthetic and real data. Finally, we use the decompositions
                  from the real image data to measure the localization
                  performance versus the undecomposed map.},

                  elements contributing to nat- uralness of synthetic scenes. In
                  many image analysis and interpretation applications, shadows
                  interfere with fundamental tasks such as object extraction and
                  description. For this reason, shadow segmentation is an
                  important step in image analysis. In this paper, we propose a
                  new cast shadow segmentation algorithm for both still and
                  moving images. The proposed technique exploits spectral and
                  geometrical properties of shadows in a scene to perform this
                  task. The presence of a shadow is first hypothesized with an
                  initial and simple evidence based on the fact that shadows
                  darken the surface which they are cast upon. The validity of
                  detected regions as shadows is further verified by making use
                  of more complex hypotheses on color invariance and geometric
                  properties of shadows. Finally, an information integration
                  stage confirms or rejects the initial hypothesis for every
                  detected region. Simulation results show that the proposed
                  algorithm is robust and efficient in detecting shadows for a
                  large class of scenes.},

                  coordinates were not available, hence the location
                  triangulation stage was not considered.}

                  segments between images. The method uses both grey-level
                  information and the multiple view geometric relations between
                  the images. For image pairs epipolar geometry facilitates the
                  computation of a cross-correlation based matching score for
                  putative line correspondences. For image triplets
                  cross-correlation matching scores are used in conjunction with
                  line transfer based on the trifocal geometry. Algorithms are
                  developed for both short and long range motion. In the case of
                  long range motion the algorithm involves evaluating a one
                  parameter family of plane induced homographies. The algorithms
                  are robust to deficiencies in the line segment extraction and
                  partial occlusion. Experimental results are given for image
                  pairs and triplets, for varying motions between views, and for
                  different scene types. The three view algorithm eliminates all
                  mismatches},

                  acquiring impressively accurate 2D and 3D models of their

                  acquire models of task-relevant objects. In this paper, we
                  introduce a novel method for acquiring models of taskrelevant
                  objects from stereo images. The proposed algorithm applies
                  methods from projective geometry and works for rectangular
                  objects, which are, in office- and museum-like environments,
                  the most commonly found subclass of geometric objects. The

  abstract =     {We have previously developed a mobile robot system which uses
                  scale-invariant visual landmarks to localize and
                  simultaneously build three-dimensional (3-D) maps of
                  unmodified environments. In this paper, we examine global
                  localization, where the robot localizes itself globally,
                  without any prior location estimate. This is achieved by
                  matching distinctive visual landmarks in the current frame to
                  a database map. A Hough transform approach and a RANSAC
                  approach for global localization are compared, showing that
                  RANSAC is much more efficient for matching specific features,
                  but much worse for matching nonspecific features. Moreover,
                  robust global localization can be achieved by matching a small
                  submap of the local region built from multiple frames. This
                  submap alignment algorithm for global localization can be
                  applied to map building, which can be regarded as alignment of
                  multiple 3-D submaps. A global minimization procedure is
                  carried out using the loop closure constraint to avoid the
                  effects of slippage and drift accumulation. Landmark
                  uncertainty is taken into account in the submap alignment and
                  the global minimization process. Experiments show that global
                  localization can be achieved accurately using the
                  scale-invariant landmarks. Our approach of pairwise submap
                  alignment with backward correction in a consistent manner
                  produces a better global 3-D map.},

                  far adjust the permissible range of the background image
                  variations according to the training samples of background
                  images. Thus, the detection sensitivity decreases at those
                  pixels having wide permissible ranges. If we can narrow the
                  ranges by analyzing input images, the detection sensitivity
                  can be improved. For this narrowing, we employ the property

                  generalization of iterative closest point (ICP) registration
                  of range images. Pointwise correspondences are chosen as the
                  closest point with respect to a weighted linear combination of
                  positional and feature distances. It is shown that, under
                  ideal noise-free conditions, correspondences formed using this
                  distance function are correct more often than correspondences
                  formed using the positional distance alone. In addition,
                  monotonic convergence to at least a local minimum is shown to
                  hold for this method. When noise is present, a method that
                  automatically sets the optimal relative contribution of
                  features and positions is described. This method trades off
                  the error in feature values due to noise against the error in
                  positions due to misalignment. Experimental results suggest
                  that using invariant features decreases the probability of
                  being trapped in a local minimum and may be an effective
                  solution for difficult range image registration problems where
                  the scene is very small compared to the model},

                  decision processes (POMDPs) provide useful tools for modeling

                  representing the topology of environments such as road

                  navigation and planning. Although stochastic maps can
                  theoretically be learned using the Baum-Welch algorithm,
                  without strong prior constraint on the structure of the model
                  it is slow to converge, requires a great deal of data, and is
                  often stuck in local minima. In this paper, we consider a
                  special case of hidden Markov models for robot-navigation
                  environments, in which states are associated with points in a
                  metric configuration space. We assume that the robot has some
                  odometric ability to measure relative transformations between
                  its configurations. Such odometry is typically not precise
                  enough to suffice for building a global map, but it does give
                  valuable local information about relations between adjacent
                  states. We present an extension of the Baum-Welch algorithm
                  that takes advantage of this local odometric information,

                  top-down processes may be a major factor in the acquisition of
                  visual information. Understanding how a top-down visual system

                  computations at the appropriate time. This is particularly
                  difficult in dynamic environments, like driving, where many
                  aspects of the visual input may be unpredictable. We therefore

                  the instructions and the local visual context. This suggests
                  that visibility of the signs requires active search, and that
                  the frequency of this search is influenced by learnt knowledge
                  of the probabilistic structure of the environment.},

                  around the same viewpoint, and a transformation matrix
                  associated with each input image. Our system first recovers
                  the camera pose for each mosaic from known line directions and
                  points, and then constructs the 3D model using all available
                  geometrical constraints. We partition constraints into soft
                  and hard linear constraints so that the modeling process can

                  distribution of a set of images. That is, given a sequence of
                  images acquired from well-separated locations, how can they be
                  arranged to best explain their genesis? The solution to this
                  problem can be viewed as an instance of robot mapping although
                  it can also be used in other contexts. We examine the problem
                  where only limited prior odometric information is available,
                  employing a feature-based method derived from a probabilistic
                  pose estimation framework. Initially, a set of visual features
                  is selected from the images and correspondences are found
                  across the ensemble. The images are then localized by first
                  assembling the small subset of images for which odometric
                  confidence is high, and sequentially inserting the remaining
                  images, localizing each against the previous estimates, and
                  taking advantage of any priors that are available. We present
                  experimental results validating the approach, and
                  demonstrating metrically and topologically accurate results
                  over two large image ensembles. Finally, we discuss the
                  results, their relationship to the autonomous exploration of
                  an unknown environment, and their utility for robot
                  localization and navigation.},

                  class of indoor mobile robots equipped with only a stereo
                  vision sensor. Our goal is to construct dense metric maps of
                  natural 3D point landmarks for large cyclic environments in
                  the absence of accurate landmark position measurements and
                  reliable motion estimates. Landmark estimates are derived from
                  stereo vision and motion estimates are based on visual
                  odometry. We distinguish between landmarks using the Scale
                  Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Our work defers from

                  measurements obtained with laser sensors. We present results

                  unknown environment using a robot equipped with a stereo
                  vision sensor. The main contribution of our work is a fully
                  automatic mapping system that operates without the use of
                  active ranger sensors (such as laser or sonic transducers),
                  can operate in real-time and can consistently produce accurate
                  maps of large-scale environments. Our approach implements a
                  Rao- Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) to solve the
                  simultaneous localization and mapping problem and uses
                  efficient data structures for real-time data association,
                  mapping, and spatial reasoning. We employ a hybrid map
                  representation that infers 3D point landmarks from image
                  features to achieve precise localization, coupled with
                  occupancy grids for safe navigation. This paper describes our
                  framework and implementation, and presents our exploration
                  method, and experimental results illustrating the
                  functionality of the system.},

                  for solving the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
                  problem in the range-sensing domain, attention has shifted to
                  implementing SLAM solutions using vision-based sensing. This
                  paper presents and analyses different models of the
                  Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) for vision-based SLAM
                  within a comprehensive application architecture. The main
                  contributions of our work are the introduction of a new robot
                  motion model utilizing structure from motion (SFM) methods and
                  a novel mixture proposal distribution that combines local and
                  global pose estimation. In addition, we compare these under a
                  wide variety of operating modalities, including monocular
                  sensing and the standard odometry-based methods. We also
                  present a detailed study of the RBPF for SLAM, addressing
                  issues in achieving real-time, robust and numerically reliable
                  filter behavior. Finally, we present experimental results

                  applications is commonplace when a prior map is available, but
                  building the map while tracking in real-time is much more
                  difficult. We describe how straight lines can be added to a
                  monocular Extended Kalman Filter Simultaneous Mapping and
                  Localisation (EKF SLAM) system in a manner that is both fast
                  and which integrates easily with point features. To achieve
                  real-time operation, we present a fast straight-line detector
                  that hypothesises and tests straight lines connecting detected
                  seed points. We demonstrate that the resulting system provides
                  good camera localisation and mapping in real-time on a
                  standard workstation, using either line features alone, or

                  revising it incrementally as new information is obtained. The

                  the map, and their uncertainties, given all the available

                  relationships. The estimates are probabilistic in nature, an
                  advance over the previous, very conservative, worst-case

                  an unknown environment taking relative observations of
                  landmarks, the estimates of these landmarks are all
                  necessarily correlated with each other because of the common
                  error in estimated vehicle location [27]. The implication of
                  this was profound: A consistent full solution to the combined
                  localisation and mapping problem would require a joint state
                  composed of the vehicle pose and every landmark position, to
                  be updated following each landmark observation. In turn, this
                  would require the estimator to employ a huge state vector (of
                  order the number of landmarks maintained in the map) with
                  computation scaling as the square of the number of landmarks.}

  abstract =     {Visual SLAM is, in recent years, a very active research area,
                  the result of activities in the convergence of the robotics
                  and computer vision communities. We present an overview of
                  techniques, from classical filtering to bundle adjustment
                  solutions, for both monocular and stereo (or multicamera)
                  systems, and emphasize that classical SLAM solutions have been
                  discarding precious sensory information. In particular, the
                  ability of vision to sense objects at infinity should be
                  exploited at its maximum because it is precisely these remote
                  objects that will provide long-term, stable angular references
                  (in the way a compass would do). Monocular SLAM systems have
                  already solved this issue, but stereo and multicamera systems
                  have not. We propose in these cases to use monocular SLAM
                  algorithms using fusion to incorporate all the information.
                  Numerous advantages like desynchronization of the sensors
                  firing, the possibility of using several unequal cameras, or
                  selfcalibration, will naturally arise. We develop a particular
                  method for extrinsically decalibrated stereo systems to
                  illustrate the proposed ideas. We evaluate the method with a
                  real indoor experiment, and highlight and discuss both its
                  assets and drawbacks.},

  abstract =     {Recent eye tracking studies in natural tasks suggest that
                  there is a tight link between eye movements and goal directed
                  motor actions. However, most existing models of human eye
                  movements provide a bottom up account that relates visual
                  attention to attributes of the visual scene. The purpose of
                  this paper is to introduce a new model of human eye movements
                  that directly ties eye movements to the ongoing demands of
                  behavior. The basic idea is that eye movements serve to reduce
                  uncertainty about environmental variables that are task
                  relevant. A value is assigned to an eye movement by estimating
                  the expected cost of the uncertainty that will result if the
                  movement is not made. If there are several candidate eye
                  movements, the one with the highest expected value is chosen.
                  The model is illustrated using a humanoid graphic figure that
                  navigates on a sidewalk in a virtual urban environment.
                  Simulations show our protocol is superior to a simple round
                  robin scheduling mechanism.},

  abstract =     {The photorealistic modeling of large-scale scenes, such as
                  urban structures, requires a fusion of range sensing
                  technology and traditional digital photography. This paper
                  presents a system that integrates automated 3D-to-3D and
                  2D-to-3D registration techniques, with multiview geometry for
                  the photorealistic modeling of urban scenes. The 3D range
                  scans are registered using our automated 3D-to-3D registration
                  method that matches 3D features (linear or circular) in the
                  range images. A subset of the 2D photographs are then aligned
                  with the 3D model using our automated 2D-to-3D registration
                  algorithm that matches linear features between the range scans
                  and the photographs. Finally, the 2D photographs are used to
                  generate a second 3D model of the scene that consists of a
                  sparse 3D point cloud, produced by applying a multiview
                  geometry (structure-from-motion) algorithm directly on a
                  sequence of 2D photographs. The last part of this paper
                  introduces a novel algorithm for automatically recovering the
                  rotation, scale, and translation that best aligns the dense
                  and sparse models. This alignment is necessary to enable the
                  photographs to be optimally texture mapped onto the dense
                  model. The contribution of this work is that it merges the
                  benefits of multiview geometry with automated registration of
                  3D range scans to produce photorealistic models with minimal
                  human interaction. We present results from experiments in
                  large-scale urban scenes.},

  abstract =     {Humanoid robotics and SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and
                  Mapping) are certainly two of the most significant themes of
                  the current worldwide robotics research effort, bu tthe two
                  fields have up until now largely run independent parallel
                  paths, despite the obvious benefit to be gained in joining the
                  two. The next major step forward in humanoid robotics will be
                  increased autonomy, and the ability of a robot to create its
                  own world map on the fly will be a significant enabling
                  technology. Meanwhile, SLAM techniques have found most success
                  with robot platforms and sensor configurations which are
                  outside of the humanoid domain. Humanoid robots move with high
                  linear and angular accelarations in full 3D, and normally only
                  vision is available as an outward-looking sensor. Building on
                  recently published work on monocular SLAM using vision, and on
                  pattern generation, we show that real-time SLAM for a humanoid
                  can indeed be achieved. Using HRP-2, we present results in
                  which a sparse 3D map of visual landmarks is acquired on the
                  fly using a single camera and deonstrated loop closing and
                  drift-free 3D motion estimation within a typical cluttered
                  indoor environment. This is achieved by tightly coupling the
                  pattern generator, the robot odometry and inertial sensing to
                  aid visual mapping within a standard EKF framework. To our
                  knowledge this is the first implementation of real-time 3D
                  SLAM for a humanoid robot able to demonstrate loop closing.},

                  in image sequences involves back- ground subtraction, or
                  thresholding the error between an estimate of the image
                  without moving objects and the current image. The numerous
                  approaches to this problem differ in the type of background
                  model used and the procedure used to update the model. This
                  paper discusses modeling each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians
                  and using an on-line approximation to update the model. The
                  Gaussian distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then
                  evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a
                  background process. Each pixel is classified based on whether
                  the Gaussian distribution which represents it most effectively
                  is considered part of the background model. This results in a
                  stable, real-time outdoor tracker which reliably deals with
                  lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and
                  long-term scene changes. This system has been run almost

  r-thrun03isrr ={If two robots discover similar maps, are they actually in the
                  same environment, or are these two different parts of the
                  environment that look alike? Clearly, this question is
                  trivially answered if the robots start at the same location.
                  If their initial location is unknown it creates a challenging
                  data association problem. This problem was addressed is a
                  recent paper [this]: the idea here is that robots continuously
                  attempt to localize themselves in each other's maps using
                  particle filters. While this is a highly promising approach,
                  it is computationally somewhat expensive, due to the high
                  costs of running K2 particle filters for K robots.}

  abstract =     {The objective of the autonomous navigation and sensing
                  experiment research (ANSER) project is to demonstrate
                  decentralized data fusion (DDF) and simultaneous localization
                  and map building (SLAM) across multiple uninhabited air
                  vehicles (UAVs). To achieve this objective, the project
                  specifies the development of four UAVs, where each UAV houses
                  up to two terrain sensors and an INS/GPS navigation system.
                  The terrain sensors include a scanning radar, laser/vision and
                  standard vision system. The DDF concept has to be shown to be
                  effective both on a single UAV and on multiple UAVs. The proof
                  of the concept will lie in the ability of the DDF structure to
                  conduct multi-target tracking problems as well as SLAM. To
                  obtain this goal, a number of subgoals are required, most of
                  which have never been attempted before on a research level.
                  The objective of this paper is to present these goals as an
                  overview of the ANSER project along with some simulated and
                  real-time results.},

                  pre-defined parametric forms (elipses,rectangles) on the
                  highway taped from the airborne camera (with moving bg). They
                  solve tracking problem and appearance learning problem
                  together. The posterior in their problem is the joint
                  distribution on (pixel ownership w.r.t. different layers)
                  ,motion, shape, and apperance over time. In their filtering
                  step, they deterministically update motion & shape parameters
                  using optimization AND build PDFs on pixel ownerships and
                  appearance pixel values with other variables fixed. This
                  filtering step is, in summary, a generalized EM where each
                  variables are updated with others fixed in an iterative
                  fashion. In addition, the background motion is estimated
                  deterministically using searching procedure under plannar
                  motion assumption. One limitation with their approach is that
                  the step of computing the pixel-ownership (masking) is rather
                  limited to certain simple shapes since their algorithm is not
                  very general, as pointed out by Jojic01cvpr. And another
                  limitation is that once the targets are lost during the
                  deterministic filtering steps, it can hardly be recovered.. as
                  they do not maintain multiple hypothesis.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents a new global matching framework for stereo
                  computation. In this framework, the second view is first
                  predicted from the reference view using the depth information.
                  A global match measure is then defined as the similarity
                  function between the predicted image and the actual image.
                  Stereo computation is converted into a search problem where
                  the goal is to find the depth map that maximizes the global
                  match measure. The major advantage of this framework is that
                  the global visibility constraint is inherently enforced in the
                  computation. This paper explores several key components of
                  this framework including (1) three color segmentation based
                  depth representations, (2) an incremental warping algorithm
                  that dramatically reduces the computational complexity, and
                  (3) scene constraints such as the smoothness constraint and
                  the color similarity constraint. Experimental results using
                  different types of depth representations are presented. The
                  quality of the computed depth maps is demonstrated through
                  image-based rendering from new viewpoints},

                  the efficiency of solving the SLAM problem, but also decreases
                  the harms of linearization, since locally linearization is not

                  particularly useful and compact representation is provided by
                  clique trees \cite{Liu89siam, Tarjan84siam}. ... In a set of
                  unpublished lecture notes, Tarjan introduced a simpler
                  algorithm known as the minimum cardinality search (MCS)
                  algorithm. \cite{Tarjan84siam} described MCS algorithms for
                  both chordal graphs and acyclic hypergraphs. The MCS algorithm
                  for chordal graphs orders the vertices in reverse order
                  beginning with an arbitrary vertex v \in V for which it sets
                  a(v) = n. At each step the algorithm selects as the next
                  vertex to label an unlabeled vertex adjacent to the largest
                  number of labeled vertices, with ties broken arbitrarily. We
                  refer the reader to \cite{Tarjan84siam} for details on how to
                  implement the algorithm to run in O(n + e) time. ... Theorem:

  abstract =     {The final goal for many visual surveillance systems is
                  automatic understanding of events in a site. Higher level
                  processing on video data requires certain lower level vision
                  tasks to be performed. One of these tasks is the segmentation
                  of video data into regions that correspond to objects in the
                  scene. Issues such as automation, noise robustness,
                  adaptation, and accuracy of the model must be addressed.
                  Current background modeling techniques use heuristics to build
                  a representation of the background, while it would be
                  desirable to obtain the background model automatically. In
                  order to increase the accuracy of modeling it needs to adapt
                  to different parts of the same scene and finally the model has
                  to be robust to noise. The building block of the model
                  representation used in this paper is multivariate
                  non-parametric kernel density estimation which builds a
                  statistical model for the background of the video scene based
                  on the probability density function of its pixels. A post
                  processing step is applied to the background model to achieve
                  the spatial consistency of the foreground objects.},

                  guarantee properties with certain state of F at least ones or
                  set of states. The complement to it are safety properties,

                  thrird type of properties is reccurence properties which
                  should guarantee that certain state will be visited infinitely
                  often. If the specification is specifies as a logical formula
                  the reactive program can be synthetized in three steps. Firts
                  the formula is translated to deterministic omega-automaton,

  abstract =     {We present an efficient probabilistic algorithm for the
                  concurrent mapping and localization problem that arises in
                  mobile robotics. The algorithm addresses the problem in which
                  a team of robots builds a map online, while simultaneously
                  accommodating errors in their odometry. At the core of the
                  algorithm is a technique that combines fast maximum likelihood
                  map growing with a Monte Carlo localizer that uses particle
                  representations. The combination of both yields an online
                  algorithm that can cope with large odometric errors typically
                  found when mapping environments with cycles. The algorithm can
                  be implemented distributedly on multiple robot platforms,
                  enabling a team of robots to cooperatively generate a single
                  map of their environment. Finally, an extension is described
                  for acquiring three-dimensional maps, which capture the
                  structure and visual appearance of indoor environments in 3D.},

                  teams of robots to build joint maps, even if their relative

                  ambiguous-which is presently an open problem in robotics. It

                  technique, which represents maps and robot poses by Gaussian
                  Markov random fields. The alignment of local maps into a
                  single global maps is achieved by a tree-based algorithm for
                  searching similar-looking local landmark configurations,
                  paired with a hill climbing algorithm that maximizes the
                  overall likelihood by search in the space of correspondences.

                  mapping and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem
                  of acquiring a map of a static environment with a mobile
                  robot. The vast majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the
                  extended Kalman filter (EKF). This paper advocates an
                  algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the extended
                  information filter (EIF). We show that when represented in the
                  information form, map posteriors are dominated by a small
                  number of links that tie together nearby features in the map.
                  This insight is developed into a sparse variant of the EIF,
                  called the sparse extended information filters (SEIF). SEIFs
                  represent maps by graphical networks of features that are
                  locally interconnected, where links represent relative
                  information between pairs of nearby features, as well as
                  information about the robot? pose relative to the map. We show
                  that all essential update equations in SEIFs can be executed
                  in constant time, irrespective of the size of the map. We also

                  maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and
                  problem solving in large-scale indoor environments.
                  Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much more

                  This paper describes an approach that integrates both
                  paradigms: grid-based and topological. Grid-based maps are
                  learned using artificial neural networks and Bayesian

                  received considerable attention in the mobile robotics
                  community. Existing approaches can largely be grouped into two
                  distinct paradigms: topological and metric. This paper
                  proposes a method that integrates both. It poses the mapping
                  problem as a statistical maximum likelihood problem, and
                  devises an efficient algorithm for search in likelihood space.
                  It presents an novel mapping algorithm that integrates two
                  phases: a topological and a metric mapping phase. The
                  topological mapping phase solves a global position alignment
                  problem between potentially indistinguishable, significant
                  places. The subsequent metric mapping phase produces a
                  fine-grained metric map of the environment in floating-point

                  foreground when we detect background for a fixed camera view
                  by using mixture of Gaussians models and multiple cues. The
                  background is modeled by three Gaussian mixtures as in the
                  work of Stauffer and Grimson. Then the intensity and texture
                  information are integrated to remove shadows and to enable the
                  algorithm working for quick lighting changes. For foreground
                  analysis, the same Gaussian mixture model is employed to
                  detect the static foreground regions without using any
                  tracking or motion information. Then the whole static regions
                  are pushed back to the background model to avoid a common
                  problem in background subtraction - fragmentation (one object
                  becomes multiple parts). The method was tested on our real
                  time video surveillance system. It is robust and run about 130
                  fps for color images and 150 fps for grayscale images at size

                  behaviour and to degrade performance for a range of different
                  tasks. However, the relationship between human locomotion
                  performance in complex environments and FOV size is currently
                  not fully known. This paper examined the effects of FOV
                  restrictions on the performance of participants manoeuvring
                  through an obstacle course with horizontal and vertical
                  barriers. All FOV restrictions tested (the horizontal FOV was
                  either 30? 75?or 120? while the vertical FOV was always 48?
                  significantly reduced performance compared to the unrestricted
                  condition. Both the time and the number of footsteps needed to
                  traverse the entire obstacle course increased with a
                  decreasing FOV size. The relationship between FOV restriction
                  and manoeuvring performance that was determined can be used to
                  formulate requirements for FOV restricting devices that are

                  structure-from-motion to SLAM is that accuracy depends heavily
                  on the baseline distance. We address this problem by selecting
                  an appropriate baseline based on criteria for the tradeoff
                  between the baseline distance and the number of feature points
                  visible in the images. Experimental results show that full 3-D

                  monocular SLAM is robustness to outliers and noise, which may

                  Thus, they have to be able to report their current state and

                  metric maps do not usually correspond to the understanding of

                  representation of the environment for spoken dialogue and task
                  specification where names used for particular locations are
                  depending on personal preferences. A question is how such
                  human oriented models can be tied to the geometric robotic
                  models needed for precise localisation and navigation. We
                  assume that this integration can be based on the information
                  potential users give to a service robot about its working
                  environment. We further believe that this information is best
                  given in an interactive setting (a "guided tour") in this
                  particular environment. This paper presents a pilot study that
                  investigates how humans present a familiar environment to a
                  mobile robot. The study is set up within our concept of Human
                  Augmented Mapping, for which we assume an initial "guided
                  tour" scenario to teach a robot its environment. Results from

                  performs Wiener filtering to make probabilistic predictions of
                  the expected background; the region-level component fills in
                  homogeneous regions of foreground objects; and the frame-level
                  component detects sudden, global changes in the image and
                  swaps in better approximations of the background. We compare
                  our system with 8 other background subtraction algorithms.

                  handling a greater set of the difficult situations that can

  abstract =     {Recently, the acquisition of three-dimensional maps has become
                  more and more popular. This is motivated by the fact that
                  robots act in the three-dimensional world and several tasks
                  such as path planning or localizing objects can be carried out
                  more reliable using three-dimensional representations. In this
                  paper we consider the problem of extracting planes from
                  three-dimensional range data. In contrast to previous
                  approaches our algorithm uses a hierarchical variant of the
                  popular Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to
                  simultaneously learn the main directions of the planar
                  structures. These main directions are then used to correct the
                  position and orientation of planes. In practical experiments
                  carried out with real data and in simulations we demonstrate
                  that our algorithm can accurately extract planes and their
                  orientation from range data.},

                  quite impressive given that there can be a huge number of
                  parameters. In terms of experimental results, the results are
                  good. But, the models have only two and three layers where the
                  number of states are quite small (total number of meta states
                  would be less than 20). For problems with large number of
                  states at every hierarchy, it is not clear what is the
                  computational complexity w.r.t. the number of states, maybe
                  the the quadratic w.r.t. the total number of concatenated meta

                  vision system for the control of a mobile robot in a dynamic
                  environment. The complexity of our robot architecture arises
                  from the wide variety of tasks that need to be performed and
                  the resulting challenge of coordinating multiple distributed,
                  concurrent processes on a diverse range of processor
                  architectures, including transputers, digital signal
                  processors and a workstation host. The system handles the
                  sensing, reasoning and action components of a robot,
                  distributed over these architectures, and responds to
                  unpredictable events in an unknown dynamic environment.
                  Spinoza relies heavily on its capability to perform real-time
                  vision processing in order to perform task such as mapping,
                  navigation, exploration, tracking and simple manipulation.},

  r-mathscinet = {This condensed paper consists of two parts: a discussion of
                  methods for solving linear algebraic equations and a
                  discussion of the errors to be expected. In the first part the
                  author states that methods of approximation are more laborious
                  than direct ones. Concerning the direct methods he shows that
                  most of them are applications of the decomposition of the
                  matrix $A$ into the product $LDU$, where $L$ and $U$ are
                  triangular matrices with diagonal elements 1 and having
                  elements not equal to zero below or above the diagonal,
                  respectively, and $D$ is a diagonal matrix. He proves that the
                  decomposition is unique. Applications of this are Gauss's
                  elimination method with the Jordan variant which the author
                  considers the best method for inverting $A$, Choleski's
                  method, Morris's escalator process and Schmidt's
                  orthogonalization. For each of these methods the author
                  measures the work of computation by counting the number of
                  multiplications and recordings.}

  abstract =     {This paper examines the processing of visual information
                  beyond the creation of the early represcntations. A
                  fundamental requirement at this level is the capacity to
                  establish visually abstract shape properties and spatial
                  relations. This capacity plays a major role in object
                  recognition, visually guided manipulation, and more abstract
                  visual thinking. For the human visual system, the perception
                  of spatial properties and relations that are complex from a
                  computational standpoint, nevertheless often appears immediate
                  and effortless. This apparent immediateness and ease of
                  perceiving spatial relations is, however, deceiving. It
                  conceals in fact a complex array of processes highly
                  specialized for the task. The proficiency of the human system
                  in analyzing spalial information far surpasses the capacities
                  of current artificial systems. The study of the computations
                  that underlie this competence may therefore lead to the
                  development of new more efficient processors for the spatial
                  analysis of visual information. It is suggested that the
                  perception of spatial relations is achieved by the application
                  to the base representations of visual routines that are
                  composed of sequences of elemental operations. Routines for
                  different properties and relations share elemental operations.
                  Using a fixed set of basic operations, the visual system can
                  assemble different routines to extract an unbounded variety of
                  shape properties and spatial relations. At a more detailed
                  level, a number of plausible basic operations are suggested,
                  based primarily on their potential usefulness, and supported
                  in part by empirical evidence. The operations discussed
                  include shifting of the processing focus, indexing to an
                  odd-man-out location, bounded activation, boundary tracing,
                  and marking. The problem of assembling such elemental
                  operations into meaningful visual routines is discussed
                  briefly.},

                  perceptual process of judging whether a point is inside a
                  closed curve. The essential property of a routine was that it
                  instantiated a procedure as opposed to requiring a specialized
                  detector of some kind. For example, seeing if two points are
                  on the same contour can be done using an operation such as
                  tracing the contour. A procedure such as this can cope with a

                  raises difficulties with major implications for the overall
                  processing of visual information. It is argued that the
                  computation of spatial relations divides the analysis of
                  visual information into 2 main stages: the bottom-up creation
                  of certain representations of the visible environment and the
                  application of visual routines, composed of elemental
                  operations, to the representations constructed in the 1st
                  stage.}

                  Examples of elementary visual routines are : 1. Shift of the
                  processing or focus (just apply particular operation to some
                  region). 2. Indexing (the region to which the operation will
                  be applied is indexed by some distinctive feature). 3. Bouded
                  activation (operation is applied over surface or boundary
                  stopping at discontinuities). 4. Boundary tracing (tracing a

                  using omnidirectional vision as the only sensor modality.
                  Local features are extracted from images obtained in sequence,
                  and are used both to cluster the images into nodes and to
                  detect links between the nodes. The algorithm is incremental,
                  reducing the computational requirements of the corresponding
                  batch algorithm. Experimental results in a complex, indoor
                  environment show that the algorithm produces topologically
                  correct maps, closing loops without suffering from perceptual
                  aliasing or false links. Robustness to lighting variations was
                  further demonstrated by building correct maps from combined
                  multiple datasets collected over a period of 2 months.},

                  robot-companions. The future of robots, as our companions, is
                  highly dependent on their abilities to understand, interpret
                  and represent the environment in an efficient and consistent
                  fashion, in a way that is comprehensible to humans. This paper
                  is oriented in this direction. It suggests a hierarchical
                  probabilistic representation of space that is based on
                  objects. A global topological representation of places with
                  object graphs serving as local maps is suggested. Experiments
                  on place classification and place recognition are also
                  reported in order to demonstrate the applicability of such a
                  representation in the context of understanding space and
                  thereby performing spatial cognition. Further, relevant
                  results from user studies validating the proposed
                  representation are also reported. Thus the theme of the work
                  is representation for spatial cognition.},

                  well with the size of the environment, line models are unable
                  to correctly represent corners or connections between objects.
                  In this paper we present an algorithm that learns sets of
                  polylines from laser range scans. Starting with an initial set
                  of polylines generated from the range scans it iteratively
                  optimizes these polylines using the Bayesian Information
                  Criterion. During the optimization process our algorithm
                  utilizes information about the angles between line segments
                  extracted from the original range scans. We present
                  experiments illustrating that our algorithm is able to learn
                  accurate and highly compact polyline maps from laser range
                  data obtained with mobile robots.},

  abstract =     {Spatial navigation in the presence of gravity restricts one's
                  displacement to two-dimensional (2D) planes. Therefore,
                  self-motion only includes translations and yaw rotations. In
                  contrast, in weightlessness, one can translate and turn in any
                  direction. In the first experiment, we compared the ability to
                  memorize a virtual three-dimensional (3D) maze after passive
                  exploration in three self-motion conditions, each using a
                  different set of rotations for turning. Subjects indicated
                  which pathway they traversed among four successive corridors
                  presented from an outside perspective. Results showed that
                  exploring in the terrestrial condition (including only yaw
                  rotations, the viewer's virtual body remaining upright)
                  allowed better recognition of the corridor than in the
                  weightless condition (which included pitch and yaw rotations
                  according to the turns), particularly for more complex 3D
                  structures. The more frequently the viewer-defined
                  (egocentric) and the global environment (allocentric)
                  verticals were aligned during exploration, the more easily
                  subjects could memorize the 3D maze, suggesting that
                  simplifying the relationship between the egocentric and
                  allocentric reference frames facilitates spatial updating.
                  Nevertheless, with practice, performance in the weightless
                  condition improved whereas in the natural terrestrial
                  condition performance remained at its initial maximum,
                  indicating that the cognitive processes involved were innate
                  for this particular condition. The second experiment revealed
                  that single rotations in the terrestrial condition must be
                  performed around the body axis in order to obtain optimal
                  spatial updating performance, and that the latter is
                  independent of the conflict with gravity that might favor this
                  condition when one is actually upright. This suggests that
                  although humans can memorize 3D-structured environments their
                  innate neurocognitive functions appear to be specialized for
                  natural 2D navigation.},
  c-richard =    {The human visual system is specialized for 2D navigation
                  rather than 3D navigation. In 3D maze learning, humans had a
                  harder time at 3D mazes than 2D mazes. In 3D mazes,
                  performance improved when the human remained oriented
                  "upwards", suggesting that spatial updating is easier when the
                  egocentric and allocentric frames are more closely aligned.},

                  widely used today for different augmented reality
                  applications. The ARToolKitPlus searches for rectangular
                  markers in the images and uses basic computer vision
                  techniques to efficiently find the four corners of the
                  markers. Knowing the location of four points on a planar
                  surface is enough to use homography and find the relative pose
                  of the marker with respect to the camera. ARToolKitPlus

                  frequency, and motion can be understood from the perspective
                  of optimal information transmission. The essence of the
                  proposal is that neural response properties at the system
                  level should be adjusted to the changing statistics of the
                  input so as to maximize information transmission. We show that
                  this principle accounts for several well-documented
                  psychophysical phenomena, including the tilt aftereffect,
                  change in contrast sensitivity and post-adaptation changes in
                  orientation discrimination. Adaptation can also be considered
                  on a longer time scale, in the context of tailoring response
                  properties to natural scene statistics. From the anisotropic
                  distribution of power in natural scenes, the proposal also
                  predicts differences in the contrast sensitivity function
                  across spatial frequency and orientation, including the
                  oblique effect.},

                  decoupled into solving a non-linear static estimation problem
                  for mapping and a three-dimensional estimation problem for
                  localization. This paper presents a new version of the D-SLAM
                  algorithm that uses an absolute map instead of a relative map
                  as presented in [1]. One of the significant advantages of
                  D-SLAM algorithm is its O(N) computational cost where N is the
                  total number of features (landmarks). The theoretical

  abstract =     {In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for SLAM that makes
                  use of a state vector consisting of quantities that describes
                  the relative locations among features. In contrast to previous
                  relative map strategies, the new state vector is compact and
                  always consists of 2n-3 elements (in a 2-D environment) where
                  n is the number of features in the map. It is also shown that
                  the information from observations can be transformed and
                  grouped into two parts: first one containing the information
                  about the map and the second one containing the information
                  about the robot location relative to the features in the map.
                  Therefore the SLAM can be decoupled into two processes where
                  mapping uses the first part of the transformed observation
                  vector and localization becomes a 3-dimensional estimation
                  problem. It is also shown that the information matrix of the
                  map is exactly sparse, resulting in potential computational
                  savings when an information filter is used for mapping. The
                  new decoupled SLAM algorithm is called D-SLAM and is

                  the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem for
                  mobile robots such that the mapping and localization can be
                  treated as two concurrent yet separated processes: DSLAM
                  (decoupled SLAM). It is shown that SLAM can be decoupled into
                  solving a nonlinear static estimation problem for mapping and
                  a lowdimensional dynamic estimation problem for localization.
                  The mapping problem can be solved using an Extended
                  Information Filter where the information matrix is shown to be
                  exactly sparse. A significant saving in the computational
                  effort can be achieved for large scale problems by exploiting
                  the special properties of sparse matrices. An important
                  feature of DSLAM is that the correlation among landmarks are
                  still kept and it is demonstrated that the uncertainty of the
                  map landmarks monotonically decrease. The algorithm is

                  localization in urban environments. Given a database of views
                  of city street scenes tagged by GPS locations, the system
                  computes the GPS location of a novel query view. We first use
                  a wide-baseline matching technique based on SIFT features to
                  select the closest views in the database. Often due to a large
                  change of viewpoint and presence of repetitive structures, a
                  large percentage of matches (> 50\%) are not correct
                  correspondences. The subsequent motion estimation between the
                  query view and the reference view, is then handled by a novel
                  and efficient robust estimation technique capable of dealing
                  with large percentage of outliers. This stage is also
                  accompanied by a model selection step among the fundamental
                  matrix and the homography. Once the motion between the closest
                  reference views is estimated, the location of the query view
                  is then obtained by triangulation of translation directions.
                  Approximate solutions for cases when triangulation cannot be
                  obtained reliably are also described. The presented system is

  abstract =     {Iterative decoding techniques have become a viable alternative
                  for constructing high performance coding systems. In
                  particular, the recent success of turbo codes indicates that
                  performance close to the Shannon limit may be achieved. In
                  this thesis, it is showed that many iterative decoding
                  algorithms are special cases of two generic algorithms, the
                  min-sum and sum-product algorithms, which also include
                  non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decod- ing. The
                  min-sum and sum-product algorithms are developed and presented
                  as generalized trellis algorithms, where the time axis of the
                  trellis is replaced by an arbitrary graph, the "Tanner graph".
                  With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting decoding
                  algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are maximum-likelihood but
                  suffer from an exponentially increasing com- plexity.
                  Iterative decoding occurs when the Tanner graph has cycles
                  (e.g., turbo codes); the resulting algorithms are in general
                  suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions are possible
                  compared to the cycle-free case. Several performance estimates
                  for iterative decod- ing are developed, including a
                  generalization of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding
                  and a characterization of errors that are uncorrectable after
                  infinitely many decoding itera-tions.},

                  gaze, when steering along a winding path. We also examine
                  patterns of free gaze behavior to determine preferred gaze
                  strategies during active locomotion. Participants were asked
                  to steer along a computer-simulated textured roadway with free
                  gaze, fixed gaze, or gaze tracking the center of the roadway.
                  Deviation of position from the center of the road was recorded
                  along with their point of gaze. It was found that visually
                  tracking the middle of the road produced smaller steering
                  errors than for fixed gaze. Participants performed best at the
                  steering task when allowed to sample naturally from the road
                  ahead with free gaze. There was some variation in the gaze
                  strategies used, but sampling was predominantly of areas
                  proximal to the center of the road. These results diverge from
                  traditional models of flow analysis.},

                  the classic pairwise point set registration task, involving
                  multiple views with multiple correspondences existing between
                  them. The proposed technique requires the computation of a

                  compute the optimal rotations. The optimal translations are

                  exploits the manner in which observations are fused into the

                  into the global map of the environment, the Constrained Local

                  do this updating, using an egocentric map. (However, other
                  studies suggest that humans use allocentric maps to remember
                  the positions of objects for longer periods of time). This
                  study also suggests that some brain regions only update object
                  positions when the updated positions are needed, in this case
                  for pointing at them. (This would be evidence of an
                  allocentric map - the object locations are not actually
                  updated during movement if they are not observed - their
                  computed egocentric positions can then be computed as needed
                  from the allocentric map).},

                  shadow detection based on the edge and region information in
                  multiple frames. First, an initial change detection mask
                  containing moving objects and cast shadows is obtained. Then a
                  Canny edge map is generated. After that, the shadow region is
                  detected and removed through multiframe integration, edge
                  matching, and region growing. Finally, a post processing
                  procedure is used to eliminate noise and tune the boundaries
                  of the objects. Our approach can be used for video
                  segmentation in indoor environment. The experimental results

                  background is modeled at different resolution level by image
                  pyramids. We develop a time dependent pyramidal Markov Random
                  Field (MRF) to represent the state of foreground/background at
                  each pixel in the pyramid. Both spatial and temporal
                  constraints in the foreground labeling process are considered
                  using three kinds of links in the MRF. The probability of
                  adding/deleting a foreground object is calculated by online
                  learning algorithm and is used as prior information in
                  computing foreground label. We use Gibbs Sampling to solve the
                  MRF under the framework of Maximum A Posterior (MAP).
                  Experimental result shows that this real-time algorithm is
                  able to segment the foreground object accurately from videos
                  with clutter in the scene.},

  abstract =     {We describe an approach to recognizing location from mobile
                  devices using image-based Web search. We demonstrate the
                  usefulness of common image search metrics applied on images
                  captured with a camera-equipped mobile device to find matching
                  images on the World Wide Web or other general-purpose
                  databases. Searching the entire Web can be computationally
                  overwhelming, so we devise a hybrid image-and-keyword
                  searching technique. First, image-search is performed over
                  images and links to their source Web pages in a database that
                  indexes only a small fraction of the Web. Then, relevant
                  keywords on these Web pages are automatically identified and
                  submitted to an existing text-based search engine (e.g.
                  Google) that indexes a much larger portion of the Web.
                  Finally, the resulting image set is filtered to retain images
                  close to the original query. It is thus possible to
                  efficiently search hundreds of millions of images that are not
                  only textually related but also visually relevant. We
                  demonstrate our approach on an application allowing users to
                  browse Web pages matching the image of a nearby location.},

                  Adjustment}},
  author =       {Z. Zhang and Y. Shan},
  year =         2001,
  month =        may,

  abstract =     {We propose a new incremental motion estimation algorithm to
                  deal with long image sequences. It applies to a sliding window
                  of triplets of images, but unlike previous approaches, which
                  rely on point matches across three or more views, we also use
                  those points shared only by two views. This is important
                  because matches between two views are more common than those
                  across more views. The problem is formulated as a series of
                  local bundle adjustments in such a way that the estimated
                  camera motions in the whole sequence are consistent with each
                  other. Two implementations are described. The first is an
                  exact one, which, based on the observation of the sparse
                  structure of the adjustment network, embeds the optimization
                  of 3D structure parameters within the optimization of the
                  camera pose parameters. This optimization embedding
                  considerably reduces the minimization complexity. The second
                  is a mathematical procedure which transforms the original
                  problem involving both 3D structure and pose parameters into a
                  much smaller one, a minimization over just the camera? pose
                  parameters. This leads to an even higher computational gain.
                  Because we make full use of local image information, our
                  technique is more accurate than previous incremental
                  techniques, and is very close to, and considerably faster
                  than, global bundle adjustment. Experiments with both
                  synthetic and real data have been conducted to compare the
                  proposed technique with other techniques, and have shown our
                  technique to be clearly superior.},

                  depth maps from a video sequence. We propose a bundle
                  optimization framework to address the major difficulties in
                  stereo reconstruction, such as dealing with image noise,
                  occlusions, and outliers. Different from the typical
                  multi-view stereo methods, our approach not only imposes the
                  photo-consistency constraint, but also explicitly associates
                  the geometric coherence with multiple frames in a statistical
                  way. It thus can naturally maintain the temporal coherence of
                  the recovered dense depth maps without over-smoothing. To make
                  the inference tractable, we introduce an iterative
                  optimization scheme by first initializing the disparity maps
                  using a segmentation prior and then refining the disparities
                  by means of bundle optimization. Instead of defining the
                  visibility parameters, our method implicitly models the
                  reconstruction noise as well as the probabilistic visibility.
                  After bundle optimization, we introduce an efficient
                  space-time fusion algorithm to further reduce the
                  reconstruction noise. Our automatic depth recovery is
                  evaluated using a variety of challenging video examples.},

                  processing and organizing spatially distributed, multimodal
                  sensor data in a sensor network. Energy-constrained networked
                  sensing systems must rely on collaborative signal and
                  information processing (CSIP) to dynamically allocate
                  resources, maintain multiple sensing foci, and attend to new
                  stimuli of interest, all based on task requirements and
                  resource constraints. Target tracking is an essential
                  capability for sensor networks and is used as a canonical
                  problem for studying information organization problems in
                  CSIP. After formulating a CSIP tracking problem in a
                  distributed constrained optimization framework, the paper
                  describes information-driven sensor query and other techniques

                  designed and used as the artificial landmark in the proposed

                  the combination of the stereo vision and laser-activated RFID
                  based on the principle of triangulation. The localization
                  system functions like an indoor GPS. Preliminary research
                  shows that the proposed system is promising to provide a

  abstract =     {Our goal is to create a visual odometry system for robots and
                  wearable systems such that localization accuracies of
                  centimeters can be obtained for hundreds of meters of distance
                  traveled. Existing systems have achieved approximately a 1\%
                  to 5\% localization error rate whereas our proposed system
                  achieves close to 0.1\% error rate, a ten-fold reduction.
                  Traditional visual odometry systems drift over time as the
                  frame-to-frame errors accumulate. In this paper, we propose to
                  improve visual odometry using visual landmarks in the scene.
                  First, a dynamic local landmark tracking technique is proposed
                  to track a set of local landmarks across image frames and
                  select an optimal set of tracked local landmarks for pose
                  computation. As a result, the error associated with each pose
                  computation is minimized to reduce the drift significantly.
                  Second, a global landmark based drift correction technique is
                  proposed to recognize previously visited locations and use
                  them to correct drift accumulated during motion. At each
                  visited location along the route, a set of distinctive visual
                  landmarks is automatically extracted and inserted into a
                  landmark database dynamically. We integrate the landmark based
                  approach into a navigation system with 2 stereo pairs and a
                  low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for increased
                  robustness. We demonstrate that a real-time visual odometry
                  system using local and global landmarks can precisely locate a
                  user within 1 meter over 1000 meters in unknown indoor/outdoor
                  environments with challenging situations such as climbing
                  stairs, opening doors, moving foreground objects etc..},

                  image segmentation. They model the optical flow in each image
                  segment as affine, and include image similarity terms for the
                  purpose of segmentation. This is interesting because they use
                  multiple "physical" models (the affine flow models) to explain
                  parts of the image, jointly inferring which model
                  instantiations explain which parts of the image. They are
                  leveraging top-down knowledge of the types of flow patterns
                  that are observed, and what image properties (i.e. appearance
                  similarity) tend to indicate that an image region is
                  contiguous. To use our language, the segmentation acts as data
                  association, determining which image regions are explained by
                  each instantiation of an affine flow model. In turn, the
                  affine flow model is a physical model, that results from the
                  assumption of objects moving rigidly in the scene, or motion
                  of the camera.},

                  \cite{barnard02}\cite{barnard03}\cite{barnard01a}\cite{barnard01}:
                  It is very important to mention the work of Barnard et. al. in
                  the context of automated annotation of images and scene
                  representation. \cite{barnard02} won the the best paper award
                  in Cognitive Vision at ECCV 2002. The goal of their work is to
                  attach words (annotations) to images and image regions. The
                  specialty is that they learn the joint statistics of words and
                  image regions from annotated training images. After having
                  learned the models, words can be attached to images outside
                  the training set (auto-annotation). The work of Barnard et.
                  al. is based on methods for modeling co-occurrence data,
                  especially the work of Hofmann and Puzicha \cite{hofmann98a}.
                  They developed a flat and hierarchical models for dyadic
                  (co-occurrence) data, that is data that has associations of
                  different types (e.g. image features and image annotations).}

                  leadership can be performed by a small part of the group. This
                  is a good example of enery usage/efficiency for group

                  the dynamic behaviour of the domain. These relationships form
                  the alphabet of a VLMM which infers the high level structure
                  of typical interactive behaviour. The learnt behaviour model
                  has generative capabilities and is also capable of recognizing
                  typical or atypical activities within a scene.}

                  prime of importance in interactive robot programming, sensor
                  technology for tracking the user's actions and behavior is
                  attached more and more importance. However, traditional
                  methods based on single sensor system input are already at
                  their limits, since PbD is an application area where real-time
                  requirement do play an important role. Thus, a sensor fusion
                  approach is proposed which serves input data for a finite
                  state automat. The input sources are on the one hand a
                  data-glove which classifies different grips and on the other
                  hand a movable camera head which tracks the movements of the
                  data glove as well as estimates object positions. Both sensor
                  sources use time efficient algorithms, since sensory data must
                  be processed in real-time. The efficiency of this approach is
                  proven in a PbD environment were flexible infusion bags are
                  handled and respective actions and object positions are
                  recognized.}

                  comparable likelihoods to hypotheses containing different
                  numbers of objects. Second, a Bayesian multi-object filter
                  which uses the abovementioned multi-blob likelihood function
                  as the observation model. Using the standard machinery of
                  particle filters, this results in a filter which is able to
                  track an unknown and varying number of objects. the paper is

                  constructing a hierarchical representation of visual input
                  that aims to enable recognition and detection of a large
                  number of object categories. Inspired by the principles of
                  efficient indexing, robust matching, and ideas of
                  compositionality, our approach learns a hierarchy of spatially
                  flexible compositions, i.e. parts, in an unsupervised,
                  statistics-driven manner. Starting with simple, frequent
                  features, we learn the statistically most significant
                  compositions (parts composed of parts), which consequently
                  define the next layer. Parts are learned sequentially, layer
                  after layer, optimally adjusting to the visual data. Lower
                  layers are learned in a category-independent way to obtain
                  complex, yet sharable visual building blocks, which is a
                  crucial step towards a scalable representation. Higher layers
                  of the hierarchy, on the other hand, are constructed by using
                  specific categories, achieving a category representation with
                  a small number of highly generalizable parts that gained their
                  structural flexibility through composition within the
                  hierarchy. Built in this way, new categories can be
                  efficiently and continuously added to the system by adding a
                  small number of parts only in the higher layers. The approach
                  is demonstrated on a large collection of images and a variety
                  of object categories.},

                  very occurance of behavioural adjustment after conflicts has

                  subsequent neural or behavioural adjustments in control. Using
                  the Stroop color naming task and controlling for repetition
                  effects, it is demonstrated that ACC conflict related activity
                  predicts both greater prefrontal activity and adjustment in
                  behaviour supporting a role of ACC conflict monitoring in the
                  engagement of cognitive control},

                  Condensation algorithm \cite{isard:98:a}. Using partitioned
                  sampling can effectively reduce the computational demands for
                  a given problem. In principle, partitioned sampling is a
                  statistical analogy \emph{hierarchical search}. Articulated
                  objects are therefore suitable in particular for this kind of
                  (multi-)object tracker. Besides partitioned sampling, the
                  paper introduces the notion of \emph{survival diagnostics} and
                  \emph{survival rate}. Both quantities can be used for
                  assessing the efficacy of a particle filter. Survival
                  diagnostic -- a.k.a. \emph{effective sample set size}
                  \cite{doucet:02:a} -- measures the effective sample set size
                  which has to be within the boundaries of 1 (one sample has
                  weight 1 all others have weight 0) and $n$ (all samples have
                  equal weight $1/n$). The survival rate is a property of a
                  given sample set meassuring the over-all tracking performance.
                  More technical details about partitioned sampling for hand
                  tracking can be found in \cite{isard:00:a}.},

                  importance in interactive robot programing. This paper
                  outlines a concept of how this can be done using visual and
                  finger measuring sensors. As input sources serve on the one
                  hand a data glove which will classify several gestures and
                  grasps and on the other hand a stereo camera head and a fixed
                  ceiling camera. The hardware used at our institute is
                  presented just as the technical concepts of processing and
                  fusioning acquired sensor information, s o called elementary
                  cognitive operators. All sensor sources must use time-effici
                  ent algorithms, since sensor data must be processed in

                  \cite{mojsilovic02}\cite{mojsilovic02a}\cite{rogowitz98}: The
                  goal of this research is semantic scene categorization for
                  CBIR. Through a set of psychophysical experiments the authors
                  identify two main axis of human categorization: human vs.
                  non-human and natural vs. man-made. From these main axis,
                  after more experiments, a set of 20 scene categories that seem
                  consistent to the subjects evolve. The subjects are asked to
                  find attributes and semantic descriptors for each of those
                  categories. In a next step these semantic features (e.g. "busy
                  scene") are translated to image-processing features (e.g.
                  "high spatial frequencies"). The image-processing features are
                  used to automatically classify unseen scenes into the semantic
                  categories. The results are mainly qualitatively, but quite
                  interesting. Unfortunately, the paper hasn't been published
                  officially yet. I just got a copy by the authors.},

                  \cite{oliva01}\cite{oliva02}\cite{torralba01a}\cite{torralba03a}:
                  The work by Oliva and Torralba is based psychophysically on
                  the PhD work of Aude Oliva \cite{oliva00}\cite{schyns94}. Even
                  when viewing scenes only for a very short time period, humans
                  are able to extract enough visual information to accurately
                  recognize its categorical properties. The authors thus use the
                  discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the windowed DFT in order
                  to describe and to learn the spatial properties of certain
                  scene categories. In \cite{oliva01}, they learn the degrees of
                  naturalness, of openness, of roughness, of expansion and of
                  ruggedness (spatial envelope properties) in order to sort
                  unseen images along these axes. In \cite{torralba01a}, the DFT
                  and the windowed DFT are used to determine the global depth of
                  a scene without absolute depth measurements. In general, the
                  goal of the authors' work is to generate scene-centered
                  descriptions from the spatial envelope properties
                  \cite{oliva02}\cite{torralba03a}.}

  abstract =     {In this paper, the design of an office-guide robot for social
                  interaction studies is presented. We are interested in
                  studying the impact of passage behaviours in casual
                  encounters. While the system offers assistance in locating the
                  appropriate office that a visitor wants to reach, it is
                  expected to engage in a passing behaviour to allow free
                  passage for other persons that it may encounter. Through use
                  of such an approach it is possible to study the effect of
                  social interaction in a situation that is much more natural
                  than out-of-context user studies. The system has been tested
                  in an early evaluation phase when it worked for almost 7
                  hours. A total of 64 interactions with people were registered
                  and 13 passage behaviors were performed to conclude that this
                  framework can be successfully used for the evaluationof
                  passing behaviors in natural contexts of operation.},

                  challenge due to lack of an interaction model. The present
                  work is based on the rules from proxemics which are used to
                  design a passing strategy. In narrow corridors the lateral
                  distance of passage is a key parameter to consider. An
                  implemented system has been used in a small study to verify
                  the basic parametric design for such a system. In total 10
                  subjects evaluated variations in proxemics for encounters with
                  a robot in a corridor setting. The user feedback indicates
                  that entering the intimate sphere of people is less
                  comfortable, however a too significant avoidance is also
                  considered unnecessary. Adequate signaling of avoidance is a
                  behaviour that must be carefully tuned.},

                  class of interest-point-based features that are stable under
                  significant changes in scale, viewpoint, and illumination,
                  making them ideally suited to landmark-based navigation.
                  Although many such features may be visible in a given view of
                  the robot's environment, only a few such features are
                  necessary to estimate the robot's position and orientation. In
                  this paper, we address the problem of automatically selecting,
                  from the entire set of features visible in the robot's
                  environment, the minimum (optimal) set by which the robot can
                  navigate its environment. Specifically, we decompose the world
                  into a small number of maximally sized regions, such that at
                  each position in a given region, the same small set of
                  features is visible. We introduce a novel graph theoretic
                  formulation of the problem, and prove that it is NP-complete.
                  Next, we introduce a number of approximation algorithms and
                  evaluate them on both synthetic and real data. Finally, we use
                  the decompositions from the real image data to measure the
                  localization performance versus the undecomposed map.}

                  using Bayesian networks. In contrast to classical cue fusion
                  approaches using a voting approach, continuous Bayesian
                  modality fusion (CBMF) combines multiple cues by reasoning
                  about the individual cue's reliability. Continuous global
                  evidence-based Bayesian modality fusion has four main
                  advantages: 1) Continuous sampling reflects the complexity of
                  Bayesian inference most appropriately. 2) Using global
                  evidence allows to consider all observations from a single
                  modality for inference. Most voting approaches take only a
                  single observation per modality into consideration. 3)
                  Bayesian inference allows to introduce new evidence one by
                  one. This provides the ability to distinguish between
                  mandatory modalities required for object tracking and optional
                  modalities which give only further hints about the presence of
                  an object. Furthermore, the nature of Bayesian modality fusion
                  allows to implement on-demand computation for computationally
                  expensive modalities that are only computet selectively for
                  disambiguating ambigous object localization.},

                  pictures are black-and-white line drawings executed according
                  to a set of rules that provide consistency of pictorial
                  representation. The pictures have been standardized on four
                  variables of central relevance to memory and cognitive
                  processing: name agreement, image agreement, familiarity, and
                  visual complexity. The intercorrelations among the four
                  measures were low, suggesting that they are indices of
                  different attributes of the pictures. The concepts were
                  selected to provide exemplars from several widely studied
                  semantic categories. Sources of naming variance, and mean
                  familiarity and complexity of the exemplars, differed
                  significantly across the set of categories investigated. The
                  potential significance of each of the normative variables to a
                  number of semantic and episodic memory tasks is discussed.}

  annote =       {This paper proposes an efficient sampling algorithm (SMC) for
                  tracking multiple objects. There are two major contribution:
                  The modeling of multiple objects as object stacks or
                  configurations and the hierarchical sampling scheme for such
                  configurations. Configurations in the sense of this paper are
                  collections of model parameters for multiple object. On one
                  side, this allows to model not only the behaviour of
                  individual objects, e.g. motion but also the behaviour of
                  object groups, in particular addition and deletion of objects.
                  On the other side, stacking multiple objects together
                  increases the problem search space exponentially. In order to
                  overcome the severe computational problems arising from the
                  increased search space, the paper introduces a hierarchical
                  sampling algorithm. In principle, the configurations are
                  broken into sub-configurations according to a subdivison of
                  the image in non-overlapping regions. This smaller

                  basic, and subordinate level in the categorization of scenes.
                  Their goal is to build a taxonomy for scene categories and to
                  identify the basic or preferred level of categorization for
                  scenes. They carry out a set of psychophysical experiments
                  which result in a taxonomy of environmental scenes. Their
                  research indicates that knowledge about scenes has a
                  hierarchical organization with an intermediate or \emph{basic}
                  level. In addition, the experiments reveal attributes,
                  activities, and parts for each category, especially the basic
                  level categories.}

                  led to a hierarchical organization of 11 categories. The
                  authors simplify this hierarchy into multiple binary
                  classifications: indoor vs. outdoor, outdoor into city vs.
                  landscape, landscape into sunset vs. mountain/forest,

                  quantization. In this work, the authors implement only the
                  city vs. landscape classification and landscape into
                  sunset/forest/mountain classes. Using features such as edge
                  direction histograms, color histograms, edge coherence, and
                  color coherence, they reach classification rates from 75\% to

                  for a monocular camera system mounted on an underactuated
                  wheeled mobile robot (WMR) subject to nonholonomic motion
                  constraints (i.e., the camera-in-hand problem). A prerecorded
                  image sequence (e.g., a video) of three target points is used
                  to define a desired trajectory for the WMR. By comparing the
                  target points from a stationary reference image with the
                  corresponding target points in the live image and the
                  prerecorded sequence of images, projective geometric
                  relationships are exploited to construct Euclidean
                  homographies. The information obtained by decomposing the
                  Euclidean homography is used to develop a kinematic
                  controller. A Lyapunov-based analysis is used to develop an
                  adaptive update law to actively compensate for the lack of
                  depth information required for the translation error system.
                  Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the control
                  design}

  abstract =     {by any state estimation algorithm. Particularly in robotics,
                  it is not very well addressed. This paper introduces a
                  multidimensional assignment (MDA)-based data association
                  algorithm for the simultaneous localization and map building
                  (SLAM) problem in mobile robot navigation. The data
                  association problem is cast in a general discrete optimization
                  framework and the MDA formulation for multitarget tracking is
                  extended for SLAM using sensor location uncertainty with the
                  joint likelihood of measurements over multiple frames as the
                  objective function. Methods for feature initialization and
                  management are also integrated into the algorithm. When
                  clutter is high and features are sparse, the compatibility
                  information of features of a single measurement frame is not
                  sufficient to make effective data-association decisions, thus
                  compromising performance of single-frame-based methods.
                  However, in a multiple-measurement-frame approach, the
                  availability of more than one frame of measurement provides
                  for more effective data-association decisions to be made, as
                  consistency of measurements are looked at in several frames of
                  measurement. Simulations are conducted to verify the
                  performance gains over the conventional nearest neighbor (NN)
                  data association algorithm and the joint compatibility branch
                  and bound (JCBB) algorithm, especially in the presence of
                  varying densities of spurious measurements and dynamic
                  objects. Experimental results with ground truth are presented
                  to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed
                  data-association method in complex and large outdoor
                  environments and its effectiveness over single-frame-based NN
                  and JCBB schemes.}

                  network architectures to increase the efficiency and
                  robustness of semantic segmentation tasks. The proposed
                  solutions are based on up-convolutional networks. We introduce
                  three different architectures in this work. The first
                  architecture, called Part-Net, is designed to tackle the
                  specific problem of human body part segmentation and to
                  provide robustness to overfitting and body part occlusion. The
                  second network, called Fast-Net, is a network specifically
                  designed to provide the smallest computation load without
                  losing representation power. Such an architecture is capable
                  of being run on mobile GPUs. The last architecture, called
                  M-Net, aims to maximize the robustness characteristics of deep
                  semantic segmentation approaches through multiresolution
                  fusion. The networks achieve state-of-the-art performance on
                  the PASCAL Parts dataset and competitive results on the KITTI
                  dataset for road and lane segmentation. Moreover, we introduce
                  a new part segmentation dataset, the Freiburg City dataset,
                  which is designed to bring semantic segmentation to highly
                  realistic robotics scenarios. Additionally, we present results
                  obtained with a ground robot and an unmanned aerial vehicle
                  and a full system to explore the capabilities of human body
                  part segmentation in the context of human--robot interaction.},

  abstract =     {We consider the following problem: a team of robots is
                  deployed in an unknown environment and it has to
                  collaboratively build a map of the area without a reliable
                  infrastructure for communication. The backbone for modern
                  mapping techniques is pose graph optimization, which estimates
                  the trajectory of the robots, from which the map can be easily
                  built. The first contribution of this paper is a set of
                  distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization: rather
                  than sending all sensor data to a remote sensor fusion server,
                  the robots exchange very partial and noisy information to
                  reach an agreement on the pose graph configuration. Our
                  approach can be considered as a distributed implementation of
                  a two-stage approach that already exists, where we use the
                  Successive Over-Relaxation and the Jacobi Over-Relaxation as
                  workhorses to split the computation among the robots. We also
                  provide conditions under which the proposed distributed
                  protocols converge to the solution of the centralized
                  two-stage approach. As a second contribution, we extend the
                  proposed distributed algorithms to work with the object-based
                  map models. The use of object-based models avoids the exchange
                  of raw sensor measurements (e.g. point clouds or RGB-D data)
                  further reducing the communication burden. Our third
                  contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation of the
                  proposed techniques, including tests in realistic Gazebo
                  simulations and field experiments in a military test facility.
                  Abundant experimental evidence suggests that one of the
                  proposed algorithms (the Distributed Gauss--Seidel method) has
                  excellent performance. The Distributed Gauss--Seidel method
                  requires minimal information exchange, has an anytime flavor,
                  scales well to large teams (we demonstrate mapping with a team
                  of 50 robots), is robust to noise, and is easy to implement.
                  Our field tests show that the combined use of our distributed
                  algorithms and object-based models reduces the communication
                  requirements by several orders of magnitude and enables
                  distributed mapping with large teams of robots in real-world
                  problems. The source code is available for download at

  abstract =     {{For robots to navigate and interact more richly with the
                  world around them, they will likely require a deeper
                  understanding of the world in which they operate. In robotics
                  and related research fields, the study of understanding is
                  often referred to as semantics, which dictateswhat does the
                  world “mean” to a robot, and is strongly tied to the question
                  ofhow to represent that meaning. With humans and robots
                  increasingly operating in the same world, the prospects of
                  human–robot interaction also bringsemantics and ontology of
                  natural language into the picture. Driven by need, as well as
                  by enablers like increasing availability of training data and
                  computational resources, semantics is a rapidly growing
                  research area in robotics. The field has received significant
                  attention in the research literature to date, but most reviews
                  and surveys have focused on particular aspects of the topic:
                  the technical research issues regarding its use in specific
                  robotic topics like mapping or segmentation, or its relevance
                  to one particular application domain like autonomous driving.
                  A new treatment is therefore required, and is also timely
                  because so much relevant research has occurred since many of
                  the key surveys were published. This survey therefore provides
                  an overarching snapshot of where semantics in robotics stands
                  today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics research in or
                  relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of
                  activity, in which semantics are extracted, used, or both.
                  Within these broad categories we survey dozens of major topics
                  including fundamentals from the computer vision field and key
                  robotics research areas utilizing semantics, including
                  mapping, navigation and interaction with the world. The survey
                  also covers key practical considerations, including enablers
                  like increased data availability and improved computational
                  hardware, and major application areas where semantics is or is
                  likely to play a key role. In creating this survey, we hope to
                  provide researchers across academia and industry with a
                  comprehensive reference that helps facilitate future research
                  in this exciting field.}},

  abstract =     {Robotics applications have hard time constraints and heavy
                  computational burdens that can greatly benefit from
                  domain-specific hardware accelerators. For the
                  latency-critical problem of robot motion planning and control,
                  there exists a performance gap of at least an order of
                  magnitude between joint actuator response rates and
                  state-of-the-art software solutions. Hardware acceleration can
                  close this gap, but it is essential to define automated
                  hardware design flows to keep the design process agile as
                  applications and robot platforms evolve. To address this
                  challenge, we introduce robomorphic computing: a methodology
                  to transform robot morphology into a customized hardware
                  accelerator morphology. In this work, we (i) present this
                  design methodology, using robot topology and structure to
                  exploit parallelism and matrix sparsity patterns in
                  accelerator hardware; (ii) use the methodology to generate a
                  parameterized accelerator design for the gradient of rigid
                  body dynamics, a key kernel in motion planning; (iii) evaluate
                  FPGA and synthesized ASIC implementations of this accelerator
                  for an industrial manipulator robot; and (iv) describe how the
                  design can be automatically customized for other robot models.
                  Using robomorphic computing, our FPGA accelerator achieves
                  speedups of 8x and 86x over CPU and GPU latency, and maintains
                  an overall speedup from 1.9x to 2.9x deployed in an end-to-end
                  coprocessor system. ASIC synthesis indicates an additional
                  factor of 7.2x. We describe how this principled approach
                  generalizes to more complex robot platforms, such as
                  quadrupeds and humanoids, as well as to other computational
                  kernels in robotics, outlining a path forward for future
                  robomorphic computing accelerators.}

  abstract =     {{Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the process
                  of constructing a global model of an environment from local
                  observations of it; this is a foundational capability for
                  mobile robots, supporting such core functions as planning,
                  navigation, and control. This article reviews recent progress
                  in SLAM, focusing on advances in the expressive capacity of
                  the environmental models used in SLAM systems (representation)
                  and the performance of the algorithms used to estimate these
                  models from data (inference). A prominent theme of recent SLAM
                  research is the pursuit of environmental representations
                  (including learned representations) that go beyond the
                  classical attributes of geometry and appearance to model
                  properties such as hierarchical organization, affordance,
                  dynamics, and semantics; these advances equip autonomous
                  agents with a more comprehensive understanding of the world,
                  enabling more versatile and intelligent operation. A second
                  major theme is a revitalized interest in the mathematical
                  properties of the SLAM estimation problem itself (including
                  its computational and information-theoretic performance
                  limits); this work has led to the development of novel classes
                  of certifiable and robust inference methods that dramatically
                  improve the reliability of SLAM systems in real-world
                  operation. We survey these advances with an emphasis on their
                  ramifications for achieving robust, long-duration autonomy,
                  and conclude with a discussion of open challenges and a
                  perspective on future research directions.}}

                  robotics have an optimization problem at their core. In most
                  of these optimization problems, the objective to be maximized
                  or minimized is composed of many different factors or terms
                  that are local in nature—that is, they depend only on a small
                  subset of the variables. A particularly insightful way of
                  modeling this locality structure is to use the concept of
                  factor graphs, a bipartite graphical model in which factors
                  represent functions on subsets of variables. Factor graphs can
                  represent a wide variety of problems across robotics, expose
                  opportunities to improve computational performance, and are
                  beneficial in designing and thinking about how to model a
                  problem, even aside from performance considerations. I discuss
                  each of these three aspects in detail and review several
                  state-of-the-art robotics applications in which factor graphs
                  have been used with great success.}

  abstract =     {We consider the problem of determining the optimal composition
                  of a heterogeneous multi-agent team for coverage problems by
                  including costs associated with different agents and subject
                  to an upper bound on the maximal allowable number of agents.
                  We formulate a resource allocation problem without introducing
                  additional non-convexities to the original problem. We develop
                  a distributed Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA) algorithm to
                  solve the optimal team composition problem. To deal with
                  non-convexity, we initialize the algorithm using a greedy
                  method and exploit the submodularity and curvature properties
                  of the coverage objective function to derive novel tighter
                  performance bound guarantees on the optimization problem
                  solution. Numerical examples are included to validate the
                  effectiveness of this approach in diverse mission space
                  configurations and different heterogeneous multi-agent
                  collections. Comparative results obtained using a commercial
                  mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem solver demonstrate
                  both the accuracy and computational efficiency of the
                  distributed PGA algorithm.}

                  strategy followed by the patroller. Implemented through a
                  Markov chain whose stationary distribution is a function of
                  the values of the assets being defended and the topology of
                  the environment, the strategy is biased towards providing more
                  protection to valuable assets, yet is provably hard to learn
                  for an opponent. After having studied its properties, we show
                  that our proposed method outperforms strategies commonly used
                  for this type of problems.}

  abstract =     {This paper introduces the deep coordination graph (DCG) for
                  collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning. DCG strikes
                  a flexible trade-off between representational capacity and
                  generalization by factoring the joint value function of all
                  agents according to a coordination graph into payoffs between
                  pairs of agents. The value can be maximized by local message
                  passing along the graph, which allows training of the value
                  function end-to-end with Q-learning. Payoff functions are
                  approximated with deep neural networks that employ parameter
                  sharing and low-rank approximations to significantly improve
                  sample efficiency. We show that DCG can solve predator-prey
                  tasks that highlight the relative overgeneralization
                  pathology, as well as challenging StarCraft II micromanagement
                  tasks.}

  abstract =     {The next chapter of the robotics revolution is well underway
                  with the deployment of robots for a broad range of commercial
                  use cases. Even in a myriad of applications and environments,
                  there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots
                  share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable
                  architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The
                  Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last
                  chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely
                  available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1
                  was not designed with many necessary production-grade features
                  and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been
                  redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth
                  by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at
                  all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and
                  architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in
                  the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the
                  influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real
                  robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of
                  challenging environments. This Review describes ROS 2’s
                  design, features, and performance with four case studies on
                  land, air, sea, and even space.}

  abstract =     {The last half decade has seen a steep rise in the number of
                  contributions on safe learning methods for real-world robotic
                  deployments from both the control and reinforcement learning
                  communities. This article provides a concise but holistic
                  review of the recent advances made in using machine learning
                  to achieve safe decision-making under uncertainties, with a
                  focus on unifying the language and frameworks used in control
                  theory and reinforcement learning research. It includes
                  learning-based control approaches that safely improve
                  performance by learning the uncertain dynamics, reinforcement
                  learning approaches that encourage safety or robustness, and
                  methods that can formally certify the safety of a learned
                  control policy. As data- and learning-based robot control
                  methods continue to gain traction, researchers must understand
                  when and how to best leverage them in real-world scenarios
                  where safety is imperative, such as when operating in close
                  proximityto humans. We highlight some of the open challenges
                  that will drive the field of robot learning in the coming
                  years, and emphasize the need for realistic physics-based
                  benchmarks to facilitate fair comparisons between control and
                  reinforcement learning approaches.}

                  of the next steps will be to enable these currently spatial
                  static robots to move freely in their working environment by
                  mounting them to a mobile platform. In the context of future

                  several of these future use cases by systematically evaluating
                  current factory structures and deducting areas for mobile

                  general idea of proximity between machines and humans for some
                  useful tasks in a shared space, with a range of options for
                  timing (continuously, synchronously, alternately, etc.). While
                  this type of human robot interaction is fairly common in many
                  fields of robotics, this survey is dedicated to the technology
                  and situations that are typical of industrial applications.
                  The current state-of-the-art in collaborative robotics for
                  industrial applications is the result of a long legacy of
                  research and development in actuation principles and
                  mechanisms from 2000s onward, together with an abundant
                  literature about improving control performances, intuitive
                  interaction modes, and perception with sensors. Safety
                  technology and standardization is discussed according to the
                  principles of risk estimation and the typical strategies for
                  risk reduction that are suitable for different classes of

                  organization of applications (planning, role assignment,
                  optimization of resources) has a major impact on both the
                  quality and the safety of collaborative robotics solutions,
                  with most of the literature focused on investigating those
                  performance metrics that combine human factors and production
                  figures. The survey is intended to delineate an interpretation
                  key for the design of collaborative robotics solution that
                  explains the relationship among all relevant factors:
                  actuation, control, safety, physical interaction, usability,

  abstract =     {The emerging autonomous mobile robots promise a new level of
                  efficiency and flexibility. However, because these types of
                  systems operate in the same space as humans, mobile robots
                  must cope with dynamic changes and heterogeneously structured
                  environments. To ensure safety, new approaches are needed that
                  model risk at runtime. This risk depends on the situation and
                  is therefore a situational risk. In this paper, we propose a
                  new methodology to model situational risk based on multi-agent
                  adversarial reinforcement learning. In this methodology, two
                  competing groups of reinforcement learning agents, namely the
                  protagonists and the adversaries, fight against each other in
                  the simulation. The adversaries represent the disruptive and
                  destabilizing factors, while the protagonists try to
                  compensate for them. The situational risk is then derived from
                  the outcome of the simulated struggle. At this point, the
                  system’s Digital Twin provides up-to-date and relevant models
                  for simulation and synchronizes the simulation with the real
                  asset. Our risk modeling differentiates the four steps of
                  intelligent information processing: sense, analyze, process,
                  and execute. To find the appropriate adversaries and actors
                  for each of these steps, this methodology builds on Systems
                  Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). Using STPA, we identify
                  critical signals that lead to losses when a disturbance under
                  certain conditions or in certain situations occurs. At this
                  point, the challenge of managing the complexity arises. We
                  face this issue using training effort as a metric to evaluate
                  it. Through statistical analysis of the identified signals, we
                  derive a procedure for defining action spaces and rewards for
                  the agents in question. We validate the methodology using the
                  example of a Robotino 3 Premium from Festo, an autonomous
                  mobile robot.}

  abstract =     {Since 2014, a specific standard has been dedicated for the
                  safety certification of personal care robots, which operate in
                  close proximity to humans. These robots serve as information
                  providers, object transporters, personal mobility carriers,
                  and security patrollers. In this article, we point out the
                  shortcomings concerning EN ISO 13482:2014, which encompasses
                  guidelines regarding the safety and design of personal care
                  robots. In particular, we argue that the current standard is
                  not suitable for guaranteeing people's safety when these
                  robots operate in public spaces. Specifically, the standard
                  lacks requirements to protect pedestrians and bystanders. The
                  guideline implicitly assumes that private spaces, such as
                  households and offices, present the same hazards as in public
                  spaces. We highlight the existence of at least three
                  properties pertaining to robots’ use in public spaces. These
                  properties include (1) crowds, (2) social norms and proxemics
                  rules, and (3) people's misbehaviours. We discuss how these
                  properties impact robots’ safety. This article aims to raise
                  stakeholders’ awareness on individuals’ safety when robots are
                  deployed in public spaces. This could be achieved by
                  integrating the gaps present in EN ISO 13482:2014 or by
                  creating a new dedicated standard.},

                  trajectories. We develop a partially observable Markov
                  decision process (POMDP) to model this sequential decision
                  making problem, and a deep reinforcement learning solution
                  methodology to learn high-quality policies. The POMDP model
                  utilizes driving scenarios, condensed into graphs, as inputs.
                  More specifically, an input graph contains information on the
                  history trajectory of the subject vehicle, predicted
                  trajectories of other agents in the scene (e.g., other
                  vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists), as well as predicted
                  risk levels posed by surrounding vehicles to devise safe,
                  comfortable, and energy-efficient trajectories for the subject
                  vehicle to follow. In order to obtain sufficient driving
                  scenarios to use as training data, we propose a simulation
                  framework to generate socially acceptable driving scenarios
                  using a real world autonomous vehicle dataset. The simulation
                  framework utilizes Bayesian Gaussian mixture models to learn
                  trajectory patterns of different agent types, and Gibbs
                  sampling to ensure that the distribution of simulated
                  scenarios matches that of the real-world dataset collected by
                  an autonomous fleet. We evaluate the proposed work in two
                  complex urban driving environments: a non-signalized
                  T-junction and a non-signalized lane merge intersection. Both
                  environments provide vastly more complex driving scenarios
                  compared to a highway driving environment, which has been
                  mostly the focus of previous studies. The framework
                  demonstrates promising performance for planning horizons as
                  long as five seconds. We compare safety, comfort, and energy
                  efficiency of the planned trajectories against human-driven
                  trajectories in both experimental driving environments, and
                  demonstrate that it outperforms human-driven trajectories in a
                  statistically significant fashion in all aspects.}

                  influence of human factors on their implementation in high
                  volume distribution centres. These human factors are:
                  resistance to change; organisational culture; communication on
                  change; and leadership. Four case companies were selected that
                  have experience with testing and introducing several types of
                  cobot and have successfully implemented (at least) one type of
                  cobot over an extended period. In-depth interviews with
                  operational decision-makers led to the identification of 66
                  critical incidents related to human factors. The results
                  demonstrate the importance of planning the implementation
                  process in phases. Employees are hesitant or resistant to the
                  change due to a lack of information, experience, and
                  communication. The decisive role of the team leader is crucial
                  to implement cobots successfully, and here the individual
                  character traits (e.g., the variance in commitment, character,
                  and motivation) influence the process as well. Although the
                  introduction of cobots is not yet widespread, and the negative
                  impact on the workforce (i.e., concerning job loss) is
                  currently low, one should be aware of the possible future
                  implications when robotisation becomes structurally embedded.
                  Therefore, this article calls for a stronger link between
                  human factors and the future of work, with a specific focus on
                  reskilling and upskilling of logistics professionals in light
                  of robotisation, rather than binary approaches in which robots
                  are primarily seen as a threat to the current workforce.},
